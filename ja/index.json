Amurum forest reserve habitat and avifauna mapping with QGIS in Nigeria ¶ Amurum forest reserve is located near the city of Jos, Plateau state, Nigeria. It was established in conjunction with the initiation of the A.P. Leventis Ornithological Research Institute (APLORI) for the purpose of natural conservation, education and research. APLORI is hosted by the Department of Zoology at the University of Jos. Yearly a group of approximately eight highly motivated students from all over Nigeria obtain training in conservation biology, statistics (with R) and as of 2011 GIS as well. During two weeks in December 2011 we studied basic GIS concepts and applied those with QGIS for various conservation purposes. In this article we describe the way in which we used QGIS to map the habitats and its determinants of Amurum reserve and how the basic habitat maps were used to obtain strata for the purpose of efficiently determining the spatial distribution of the avifauna including the biodiversity.\nTraining Group Mapping elevation, hill shade, slope and habitats ¶ Mapping elevation and groundtruthing: We downloaded (free) elevation data originating from the NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) for the area in which Amurum is located. (Information about the global elevation data set can be found here: http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/elevation/item/45-srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database-v41). The GdalTools were used to merge original data sets and to clip a smaller area containing the reserve so that the raster data sets remained relatively small. By means of GPS we collected elevations at various locations in the reserve. Overall, the elevations of the SRTM data set corresponded well to the gps-collected elevations. Terrain models in GdalTools were used to calculate hills hades and slopes for the area. These variables are important from an ecological point of view because they are strongly associated with the type of habitat. QGIS screenshot Since we intended to develop a good-looking map, we interpolated the original (clipped) elevation map to obtain a higher resolution map. We used the warp tool in GdalTools. By means of the contour tool we obtained smooth contour lines. Coordinates of the boundary of the reserve were obtained by walking along the boundaries of the reserve with a GPS. The waypoints and tracks stored in the GPS were smoothly imported using the GPS Tools. The imported waypoints and tracks were used to construct a polygon shapefile. The tracks inside the reserve were mapped in a similar fashion. We were able to quickly and precisely construct a habitat map of Amurum using a Google satellite image which we got into the workspace with the Openlayers plugin. The reserve has three types of distinct habitat: Savannah, Gallery forest and Rocky outcrop. On the basis of the satellite image we used the editor to draw polygons demarcating the three habitats. Setting the snapping options correctly allowed the construction of non-overlapping polygons. Mapping bird distributions and diversity ¶ The habitat maps were used to generate random locations. The area of the various types of habitat were used to generate a number of locations proportional to the surface of each habitat type (stratification).\nTraining Group The random points in fTools were used for this purpose. All the locations were visited during two mornings by four groups of students (2 per group) giving a total of 38 random locations dispersed throughout the reserve. The observation data were entered in a spreadsheet and analyzed using R. In addition, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index was calculated using R. After merging the location file with the resulting observation data it was exported as a csv file which was loaded into QGIS using the \u0026ldquo;Add delimited text layer\u0026rdquo; tool. On the basis of the above mentioned layers a map was constructed presenting some of the most important landscape features and avian diversity of the Amurum reserve.\nConclusion ¶ Overall, the course was a great success. We - a group of students with no previous GIS experience —— enjoyed working with QGIS a lot. Within just two weeks time we were able to develop an extremely useful map of the reserve. Amongst others, the extents of the various habitats were determined which allows for stratification and thus for better estimates of abundances of various kinds of organisms. Basically we are now able to do better ecological research using QGIS as an open source platform.\nQGIS map: Diversity of Amurum Forest Reserve Authors ¶ Abengowe Elmond Chiadikaobi, Adeyanju Temidayo Esther, Akiemen Nerioya, Albert Malangale Tauje, Azi Abok Joel, Echude Daniel, Eelke Folmer, Nwaogu Chima Josiah, Onoja Joseph Daniel, Yadok Biplang Godwill\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/case-studies/nigeria_jos/","tags":null,"title":"Amurum forest reserve habitat and avifauna mapping with QGIS in Nigeria"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Annual General Meetings ¶ Starting in 2016 coinciding with the establishment of a formal legal entity (Swiss “Verein”), we hold a virtual annual general meeting where QGIS Voting Members approve the budget for the coming year, the financial report for the past year, elect any new project members and so on.

If you are unable to locate an answer to your question, please contact our Financial and Marketing Advisor (trademark@qgis.org).\nReport abuse ¶ If you know of people, organizations or companies using the QGIS name or logo as part of a trademark without a permission, or if you see references to QGIS without the proper attributions, please feel free to let them know about our trademark. We would appreciate if you could notify us through a mail to our Financial and Marketing Advisor (trademark@qgis.org).\nFrequently Asked Questions ¶ Q: When do I have to show proper attribution?\nA: Whenever and however you use the term QGIS in print, on the internet, or in audio broadcasts, you should always give proper attribution to QGIS project. For more information see “Trademark Attribution.” Q: I am registering or have registered a trademark with my country’s trademark authority. Do I still need a permission?\nA: Yes, assuming your trademark includes the element QGIS and it is being used in connection with software-related goods and services. Please note, the permission applies to the QGIS trademark whether or not they are registered with a trademark authority. If you are using the term QGIS as a trademark (whether or not registered), you need to apply for a permission. Q: I am a commercial entity (for example, a company, partnership or sole proprietor, profit or non-profit) selling software-related goods or services and using the word “QGIS” in the entity’s name. Do I need to apply for a permission?\nA: Using QGIS in the entity’s name is not permitted because you are using QGIS as part of a trademark in connection with software-related goods or services. Software-related goods are computer programs and systems, or packages bundling software with tools, utilities, hardware, etc. Software-related services are services that deploy, document, facilitate the use of, or enhance computer programs and systems. Even if you don’t use QGIS as part of the entity’s name, if the entity has a product or service (whether sold or given away for free) that uses “QGIS” in its name, you still need a permission for the use of the word QGIS in the name of the products or services.\nQ: If I get a permission for my trademark, will QGIS refuse to grant similar permissions to marks that are the same as, or confusingly similar to, my mark?\nA: No, QGIS will not attempt to ensure exclusivity or protect marks from infringement. QGIS considers the protection of trademarks against infringement to be the responsibility of the trademark owner. QGIS is not a dispute resolution authority, and does not become involved in disputes between trademark owners.\nQ: Trademark Registration Consent: My organization has applied to register a trademark for software-related goods or services that includes QGIS as an element. The application was rejected for confusing similarity to QGIS trademark. If I have trademark usage permission, will QGIS consent to my registration?\nA: No. The QGIS trademark usage permission is not a consent for the registration of other trademarks. To protect the QGIS mark from dilution, we do not consent to the registration of trademarks found to be confusingly similar to the QGIS mark.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/community/organisation/guidelines/","tags":null,"title":"Brand Guidelines"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Bugs, Features and Issues ¶ QGIS is a largely volunteer driven project, and is the work of a dedicated team of developers, documenters, translators and supporters. Despite the efforts of the team to release QGIS without bugs, there may remain some bugs. If you find a bug or want new features to be added, please report it!\nWhere to report? ¶ Each part of the QGIS Project has a dedicated place where issues (feature requests or bugs) can be reported, managed and discussed. Depending on the area you encountered the issue, the table below indicates the right repository to report it:\nPlace you found the bug or request a feature for Place to report the issue Applications (QGIS Desktop, QGIS Server) https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues QGIS Website (https://qgis.org) https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/issues QGIS Documentation (https://docs.qgis.org) https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues C++ API (https://qgis.org/api) https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues PyQGIS API (https://qgis.org/pyqgis) https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues (for contents) and https://github.com/qgis/pyqgis/issues (for formatting) External plugins The author repository set in the plugin description For help and questions, please contact the Mailing lists.\nReporting issues on QGIS applications ¶ QGIS applications (QGIS Desktop and QGIS Server) issues are available in Github. In order to submit or comment a report, you need to register and login.\nBefore reporting an issue ¶ Before filing an issue, verify that you are running the currently supported versions 3.34.9 or 3.38.1 or the development version 3.39 (see also Release schedule) and review the currently open issues to make sure that you aren’t creating a duplicate. If you have additional information on an issue, you can add it to the existing ticket. Third party plugins might also cause problems. If you have installed any, you should also verify that the problem is still reproducible without them. Please don’t report multiple unrelated bugs in a single bug report.\nWhen you’re logged in, a New Issue button is available. Select it and follow the instructions there.\nBefore sending the report, please check the formatting of your report by clicking on “Preview”. Please avoid editing existing reports, if not for typos. Better add further comments in any other case.\nCreating a backtrace ¶ If you have a crash it might be useful to include a backtrace as the bug might be not reproducible on another machine.\nOn Linux QGIS automatically tries to use gdb to connect to the crashing process to produce a backtrace. But some distributions disable the possiblity to connect debuggers to a running processes. In that case gdb only produces a rather useless message like:\nQGIS died on signal 11Could not attach to process. If your uid matches the uid of the target process, check the setting of /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope, or try again as the root user. For more details, see /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf ptrace: Operation not permitted. No thread selected No stack. gdb returned 0 Aborted (core dumped)\nIn that case you should reenable that option by setting kernel.yama.ptrace_scope to 0 in /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf (or /etc/sysctl.conf or some other file in /etc/sysctl.d/) and run sysctl -p as root. When you reproduce the crash after that, a backtrace will be printed instead.\nIf you cannot reproduce the crash, there should still be a core dump in the current directory, that can be analysed after the process has already terminated. It’s called core, though the filename may include a dot followed by the process id on some systems.\nOn some distributions the creation of core dumps is also disabled. In the event that you just get Aborted instead of Aborted (core dumped) when the crash occurs. Then you need to run ulimit -c unlimited before starting QGIS. You can also include that in your .profile, so that it’s always enabled when you login.\nTo produce a backtrace from the core file, start gdb /path/to/the/qgis/binary core. The binary is usually /usr/bin/qgis or /usr/bin/qgis.bin on Debian with the GRASS plugin installed. In gdb you run bt which will produce the backtrace.\nLog output on Windows ¶ The nightly build in OSGeo4W (package qgis-dev) is built with debugging output, that you can view with DebugView. If the problem is not easy to reproduce, the output might shed some light about where QGIS crashes.\nReporting issues on QGIS web site or documentation ¶ QGIS project provides an active web site and a rich documentation. Despite our efforts, if you find an out of date information, a wrong or unclear statement or miss valuable information, please feel free to report it.\nThe main sources of these documents are hosted and managed in GitHub repositories so in order to report bugs or submit patches, you need a GitHub account and login.\nTo get started, first Create a GitHub account.\nThen, choose the appropriate repository:\nhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/issues for QGIS documentation\nhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website/issues for the web site\nCheck if the issue you’d like to report is not already entered.\nClick New Issue, type a title and a clear description for your issue.\nWhen you’re finished, click Submit new issue.\nNote\nA Fix me link is provided at the bottom of any page of the web site to help you directly improve this page and submit pull request.\nThis option is also available in the footer of the documentation.\nReporting plugin issues ¶ Most of the plugins in QGIS are published in the official QGIS Plugins repository. Bugs or feature requests relative to them must be opened in their respective bug tracking system:\nFor any plugin available in QGIS repository, you’ll find in its metadata a link to its bug tracker. Otherwise, consult the plugin documentation to find the address of the relevant bug tracking system or a developer to contact.\nIf no information is available, please report it to the Developer mailing-list.\nFor other plugins, we have no means to ensure such information is provided.\nSubmitting a Patch to QGIS projects ¶ In addition to issue report, you can help to fix issues. Fixing issues is done in GitHub through pull requests. You need to fork the repository you want to contribute to and submit pull requests at:\nhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS for QGIS Desktop or QGIS Server applications\nhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website for the web site at https://qgis.org\nhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation for the documentation available at https://docs.qgis.org\nYou can find a few guidelines that will help you to easily get your patches and pull requests into QGIS projects at Submitting Pull Requests. And more widely, you may need to read the Development Process chapter.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/resources/support/bug-reporting/","tags":null,"title":"Bug Reporting"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Case Studies ¶ Amurum forest reserve habitat and avifauna mapping with QGIS in Nigeria Creating the Fundy Footpath Trail Map with QGIS Danish Demining Group using QGIS in Afghanistan Historical Gazetteer of the Crimea Lynx habitat analysis in the Southern Carpathians Producing an arcHYDRO like output with QGIS QGIS —— an interesting instrument for forestry planning concepts at local and regional level QGIS and Forest Fire Risk Mapping in Portugal QGIS and GRASS applied to paleontological survey in Western Portugal QGIS and GRASS for modelling ecological corridors for wolves in North Portugal QGIS and GRASS in Biogeographical Research in the Iberian Peninsula QGIS and GRASS in Local Government Bushfire Hazard Mapping QGIS as major GIS software in the Laboratory on Experimental and Applied Geography QGIS at high school —— the urban green spaces in Rada Tilly coastal town, Chubut province, Argentina QGIS at the Federal Department of Town and Country Planning, Peninsular Malaysia QGIS for distance learning and teaching GIS at Universities QGIS for monitoring tigers (using camera traps in Nameri Tiger Reserve, Assam, India Sonitpur District) QGIS geoprocessing model to simplify first level seismic microzonation analysis QGIS in the governmental FOSSGIS stack of the Canton of Solothurn in Switzerland QGIS Maps Historic Herpetofaunal Records (in Missouri, USA) QGIS to describe the Cesena\u0026#39;s Wall QGIS Trainings at NIRD Jaipur Centre, India Quantarctica: An Antarctic GIS package The Burgundy Historical Landscapes Working Group The Research Institute for Geo-hydrological Protection of Turin —— Aerial photo archive management The use of QGIS in the Geodata Infrastructure of the City of Uster Trainings \u0026amp; Research activities using QGIS at NIRD\u0026amp;PR-NERC, Guwahati, India Ukrainian open initiative of creating tools for spatial planning in the QGIS environment Use of python console to prepare offline map from WMS (tile downloader) Use of QGIS at the Financial Times Graphics Team Use of QGIS at the Ministry of Social Development of Uruguay (MIDES) Using a free GIS at Jaime Moniz Secondary School: QGIS Using open source tools for characterization of a landscape.

The application process requires applicants to detail their contributions to the QGIS project and make their training materials available for review. Contributions to the QGIS project include activities such as:\nDevelopment/commits to QGIS Contributions to the QGIS documentation and training materials Translation of QGIS materials Authoring plugins Filing bug reports Financially supporting new feature development Financial contributions to and sponsorship of QGIS Involvement in your local QGIS User Group Publication of open QGIS course ware Authoring QGIS books To contact the certification team, please write to certification@qgis.org.\nCertification Process ¶ Application ¶ You are required to provide the training material for each of your courses. This includes exercises, lectures and data. This material will be reviewed for currentness, accurate representation of the QGIS project and overall quality. If the material is not of adequate quality, this can be cause for refusal.\nFollowing an initial review, the application will be sent to local QGIS groups for their opinion. This part of the review should be completed within a month. If there is not a local QGIS user group, the QGIS Project Steering Committee (PSC) will make a determination based on material provided and your reputation in the community. In this latter case you are encouraged to establish a local QGIS User Group. If you are not considered a member in good standing of the QGIS community, this could be a reason for refusal.\nThe PSC will make the final determination. If accepted as a QGIS Certified Organization, your contributions to the project will be published for transparency.\nIf approved, you are required to pay a €20 certification fee to the QGIS project for each certificate you issue. This creates a mechanism for financial support of the project. Payments for certificates are made either using online credit card transactions or on request by regular invoice and SEPA wire transfer. Payments can be handled in batches for many certificates at once.\nYou can apply using this form (make sure to first create a login). You can find more details about the certification programme here (we advise you to read this before registering).\nCourse Certification Workflow ¶ ","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/community/certification/","tags":null,"title":"Certification Programme"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 2.0 ¶ Release date: 2013-09-09\nAnalysis tools Feature: Processing Commander Feature: Heatmap Plugin Improvements Feature: Processing Support Feature: Processing Modeller Application and Project Options Feature: Define default startup project and project templates Feature: System environment variables Feature: User-defined zoom scales Browser Feature: Improvements to in-app browser panel Data Providers Feature: Raster Data Provider overhaul Feature: Oracle Spatial support Feature: Web Coverage Service provider added Feature: Raster 2% cumulative cut by default Feature: WMS identify format Feature: WMTS Support General Feature: Quantum GIS is now known only as 'QGIS' Labelling Feature: New labelling system Feature: Expression based label properties Feature: Older labelling engine deprecated Layer Legend Feature: Legend visual feedback and options Feature: Duplicate existing map layer Feature: Multi-layer toggle editing commands Map Composer Feature: HTML Map Items Feature: Multipage support Feature: Expressions in composer labels Feature: Auto snap lines Feature: Manual Snap Lines Feature: Map series generation Feature: Automatic overview support in map frame Feature: Layer blending Feature: HTML Label support Feature: Multicolumn composer legend Feature: Updates to map composer management Plugins Feature: Revamped plugin manager Programmability Feature: New Python Console Feature: Even more expression functions Feature: Custom expression functions Feature: New cleaner Python API Feature: Code compatibility with version 1.x releases Feature: Python project macros Symbology Feature: Data defined properties Feature: Improved symbol layer management Feature: Support for transparency in colour definitions Feature: Color Control for Raster Layers Feature: Copy symbology between layers Feature: Save styles in your database Feature: Colour ramp support Feature: Set custom default styles for all layer types User Interface Feature: New icon theme Feature: Side tabs, collapsable groups Feature: Soft notifications Feature: Application custom font and Qt stylesheet Feature: Live color chooser dialogs and buttons Feature: SVG Annotations Feature: Drag and drop form builder Feature: Default action tool Analysis tools ¶ Feature: Processing Commander ¶ For quick access to geoprocessing functionality, just launch the processing commander (Ctrl + Alt + M) and start typing the name of the tool you are looking for. Commander will show you the available options and launch them for you. No more searching through menus to find tools. They are now right at your fingertips.\nFeature: Heatmap Plugin Improvements ¶ The heatmap plugin has seen numerous improvements and optimisations, resulting in much faster creation of heatmaps. Additionally, you now have the choice of which kernel function is used to create the heatmap.\nFeature: Processing Support ¶ The SEXTANTE project has been ported to and incorporated into QGIS as core functionality. SEXTANTE has been renamed to 'Processing' and introduces a new menu in QGIS from where you can access a rich toolbox of spatial analysis tools. The processing toolbox has incredibly rich functionality - with a python programming API allowing you to easily add new tools, and hooks to provide access to analysis capabilities of many popular open source tools such as GRASS, OTB, SAGA etc.\nFeature: Processing Modeller ¶ One of the great features of the new processing framework is the ability to combine the tools graphically. Using the Processing Modeller, you can build up complex analysis from a series of small single purpose modules. You can save these models and then use them as building blocks in even more complex models. Awesome power integrated right into QGIS and very easy to use!\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Define default startup project and project templates ¶ With QGIS 2.0 you can specify what QGIS should do when it starts: New Project (legacy behaviour, starts with a blank project), Most recent (when you start QGIS it will load the last project you worked on), Specific (always load a specific project when QGIS starts). You can use the project template directory to specify where your template projects should be stored. Any project that you store in that directory will be available for use as a template when invoking the Project --\u0026gt; New from template menu.\nFeature: System environment variables ¶ Current system environment variables can now be viewed and many configured within the application Options dialog. Useful for platforms, such as Mac, where a GUI application does not necessarily inherit the user's shell environment. Also useful for setting/viewing environment variables for the external tool sets controlled by the processing toolbox, e.g. SAGA, GRASS; and, for turning on debugging output for specific sections of the source code.\nFeature: User-defined zoom scales ¶ A listing of zoom scales can now be configured for the application and optionally overridden per project. The list will show up in the Scale popup combo box in the main window status bar, allowing for quick access to known scales for efficiently viewing and working with the current data sources. Defined scales can be exported to an XML file that can be imported into other projects or another QGIS application.\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Improvements to in-app browser panel ¶ Directories can be filtered by wildcard or regex expressions New Project home (parent directory of current project) View Properties of the selected directory in a dialog Choose which directories to Fast scan Choose to Add a directory directly to Favourites via filesystem browse dialog New /Volumes on Mac (hidden directory for access to external drives) New OWS group (collation of available map server connections) Open a second browser (View -\u0026gt; Panels -\u0026gt; Browser (2)) for drag-n-drop interactions between browser panels Icons now sorted by item group type (filesystem, databases, map servers) Layer Properties now have better visual layout Data Providers ¶ Feature: Raster Data Provider overhaul ¶ The raster data provider system has been completely overhauled. One of the best new features stemming from this work is the ability to 'Layer -\u0026gt; Save As...' to save any raster layer as a new layer. In the process you can clip, resample, and reproject the layer to a new Coordinate Reference System. You can also save a raster layer as a rendered image so if you for example have single band raster that you have applied a colour palette to, you can save the rendered layer out to a georeferenced RGB layer.\nFeature: Oracle Spatial support ¶ QGIS 2.0 now includes Oracle Spatial support.\nFeature: Web Coverage Service provider added ¶ QGIS now provides native support for Web Coverage Service layers - the process for adding WCS is similar to adding a WMS layer or WFS layer.\nFeature: Raster 2% cumulative cut by default ¶ Many raster imagery products have a large number of outliers which result in images having a washed out appearance. QGIS 2.0 intoduces much more fine grained control over the rendering behaviour of rasters, including using a 2% - 98% percent cumulative cut by default when determining the colour space for the image. The image here shows QGIS 1.8 (left) versus QGIS 2.0 (right) when rendering the same image with default settings.\nFeature: WMS identify format ¶ It is now possible to select the format of the identify tool result for WMS layers if multiple known formats are supported by the server. The supported formats are HTML, feature (GML) and plain text. If the feature (GML) format is selected, the result is in the same form as for vector layers, the geometry may be highlighted and the feature including attributes and geometry may be copied to clipboard and pasted to another layer.\nFeature: WMTS Support ¶ The WMS client in QGIS now supports WMTS (Web Mapping Tile Service) including selection of sub-datasets such as time slices. When adding a WMS layer from a compliant server, you will be prompted to select the time slice to display.\nGeneral ¶ Feature: Quantum GIS is now known only as 'QGIS' ¶ The 'Quantum' in 'Quantum GIS' never had any particular significance and the duality of referring to our project as both Quantum GIS and QGIS caused some confusion. We are streamlining our project and as part of that process we are officially dropping the use of the word Quantum - henceforth we will be known only as QGIS (spelled with all letters in upper case). We will be updating all our code and publicity material to reflect this.\nLabelling ¶ Feature: New labelling system ¶ The labelling system has been totally overhauled - it now includes many new features such as drop shadows, 'highway shields', many more data bound options, and various performance enhancements. We are slowly doing away with the 'old labels' system, although you will still find that functionality available for this release, you should expect that it will disappear in a follow up release.\nFeature: Expression based label properties ¶ The full power of normal label and rule expressions can now be used for label properties. Nearly every property can be defined with an expression or field value giving you more control over the label result. Expressions can refer to a field (e.g. set the font size to the value of the field 'font') or can include more complex logic.\nExamples of bindable properties include:\nFont Size Style Buffer size Feature: Older labelling engine deprecated ¶ Use of the older labelling engine available in QGIS \u0026lt;= 1.8 is now discouraged (i.e. deprecated), but has not been removed. This is to allow users to migrate existing projects from the old to new labelling engine.\nThe following guidelines for working with the older engine in QGIS 2.0 apply:\nDeprecated labelling tab is removed from vector layer properties dialog for new projects or older opened projects that don't use that labelling engine. Deprecated tab remains active for older opened projects, if any layer uses them, and does not go away even if saving the project with no layers having the older labelling engine enabled. Deprecated labelling tab can be enabled/disabled for the current project, via Python console commands, e.g.:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; QgsProject.instance().writeEntry('DeprecatedLabels', '/Enabled', True | False) # or \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; QgsProject.instance().removeEntry('DeprecatedLabels', '/') NOTE: There is a very high likelihood the deprecated labelling engine will be completely removed prior to the next stable release of QGIS. Please migrate older projects.\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: Legend visual feedback and options ¶ Total count for features in layer, as well as per symbol Vector layers in edit mode now have a red pencil to indicate uncommitted (unsaved) edits Active layer is now underlined, to indicate it in multi-layer selections or when there is no selection Clicking in non-list-item whitespace now clears the selection Right-clicks are now treated as left-clicks prior to showing the contextual menu, allowing for one click instead of two Groups and layers can optionally be in a bold font style Raster layer generated preview icons can now be turned off, for projects where such rendering may be slow Feature: Duplicate existing map layer ¶ Duplicate selected vector and raster layers in the map layer legend. Similar to importing the same data source again, as a separate layer, then copy/pasting style and symbology attributes.\nFeature: Multi-layer toggle editing commands ¶ User can now select multiple layers in legend and, if any of those are vector layers in edit mode, choose to save, rollback, or cancel current uncommitted edits. User can also choose to apply those actions across all layers, regardless of selection.\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: HTML Map Items ¶ You can now place html elements onto your map.\nFeature: Multipage support ¶ A single composer window can now contain more then one page.\nFeature: Expressions in composer labels ¶ The composer label item in 1.8 was quite limited and only allowed a single token $CURRENT_DATE to be used. In 2.0 full expression support has been added too greater power and control of the final labels.\nA label with an expression such as:\nThis was printed on: [% format_date( $now, 'dd.MM.yyyy')%] will be evaluated at print time (and display time) to generate:\nThis was printed on: 06.09.2013 When atlas generation is enabled the currently active features' attribute values will also be accessible in the expressions allowing such things as:\nAsset ID [% \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot; %] and the Tree Type is [% \u0026quot;TreeType\u0026quot; %] Feature: Auto snap lines ¶ Having nicely align map items is critical to making nice printed maps. Auto snapping lines have been added to allow for easy composer object alignment by simply dragging an object close to another.\nFeature: Manual Snap Lines ¶ Sometimes you need to align objects a curtain distance on the composer. With the new manual snapping lines you are able to add manual snap lines which allow for better align objects using a common alignment. Simply drag from the top or side ruler to add new guide line.\nFeature: Map series generation ¶ Ever needed to generate a map series? Of course you have. The composer now includes built in map series generation using the atlas feature. Coverage layers can be points, lines, polygons, and the current feature attribute data is available in labels for on the fly value replacement.\nFeature: Automatic overview support in map frame ¶ Need to show the current area of the main map frame in a smaller overview window. Now you can. The map frame now contains the ability to show the extents of other and will update when moved. Using this with the atlas generation feature now core in the composer allows for some slick map generation. Overview frame style uses the same styling as a normal map polygon object so your creativity is never restricted.\nFeature: Layer blending ¶ Layer blending makes it possible to combine layers in new and exciting ways. While in older versions, all you could do was to make the layer transparent, you can now choose between much more advanced options such as \u0026quot;multiply\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;darken only\u0026quot;, and many more.\nBlending can be used in the normal map view as well as in print composer. For a short tutorial on how to use blending in print composer to make the most out of background images, see \u0026quot;Vintage map design using QGIS\u0026quot;.\nFeature: HTML Label support ¶ HTML support has been added map composer label item to give you even more control over your final maps. HTML labels support full css styles sheets, html, and even javascript if you are that way inclined.\nFeature: Multicolumn composer legend ¶ The composer legend now supports multiple columns. Splitting of a single layer with many classes into multiple columns is optional. Single symbol layers are now added by default as single line item. Three different styles may be assigned to layer/group title: Group, Subgroup or Hidden. Title styles allow arbitrary visual grouping of items. For example, a single symbol layer may be displayed as single line item or with layer title (like in 1.8), symbols from multiple following layers may be grouped into a single group (hiding titles) etc. Feature counts may be added to labels.\nFeature: Updates to map composer management ¶ The following improvements have been made to map composer management:\nComposer name can now be defined upon creation, optionally choosing to start from other composer names Composers can now be duplicated New from Template and from Specific (in Composer Manager) creates a composer from a template located anywhere on the filesystem Parent project can now be saved directly from the composer work space All composer management actions now accessible directly from the composer work space Plugins ¶ Feature: Revamped plugin manager ¶ In QGIS 1.x managing plugins was somewhat confusing with two interfaces - one for managing already installed plugins and one for fetching python plugins from an only plugin repository. In QGIS 2.0 we introduce a new, unified, plugin manager which provides a one stop shop for downloading, enabling/disabling and generally managing you plugins. Oh, and the user interface is gorgeous too with side tabs and easy to recognise icons!\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: New Python Console ¶ The new Python console gives you even more power. Now the with auto complete support, syntax highlighting, adjustable font settings. The side code editor allows for easier entry of larger blocks of code with the ability to open and run any Python file in the QGIS session.\nFeature: Even more expression functions ¶ With the expression engine being used more and more though out QGIS to allow for things like expression based labels and symbol, many more functions have been added to the expression builder and are all accessible though the expression builder. All functions include comprehensive help and usage guides for ease of use.\nFeature: Custom expression functions ¶ If the expression engine doesn't have the function that you need. Not to worry. New functions can be added via a plugin using a simple Python API.\nFeature: New cleaner Python API ¶ The Python API has been revamped to allow for a more cleaner, more pythonic, programming experience. The QGIS 2.0 API uses SIP V2 which removes the messy toString(), toInt() logic that was needed when working with values. Types are now converted into native Python types making for a much nicer API. Attributes access is now done on the feature itself using a simple key lookup, no more index lookup and attribute maps.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; feature['mycolumn'] = 10 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; feature['mycolumn'] 10 The way features are read from a layer has also been improved allowing for multithreading in the future versions.\nfor feature in layer.getFeatures(): print feature['mycolumn'] Feature: Code compatibility with version 1.x releases ¶ As this is a major release, it is not completely API compatible with previous 1.x releases. In most cases porting your code should be fairly straightforward - you can use this guide to get started. Please use the developer mailing list if you need further help.\nFeature: Python project macros ¶ A Python module, saved into a project.qgs file, can be loaded and have specific functions run on the following project events:\nopenProject() saveProject() closeProject() Whether the macros are run can be configured in the application options.\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Data defined properties ¶ With the new data defined properties, it is possible to control symbol type, size, color, rotation, and many other properties through feature attributes.\nFeature: Improved symbol layer management ¶ The new symbol layer overview uses a clear, tree-structured layout which allows for easy and fast access to all symbol layers.\nFeature: Support for transparency in colour definitions ¶ In most places where you select colours, QGIS now allows you to specify the alpha channel (which determins how transparent the colour should be). This allows you to create great looking maps and to hide data easily that you don't want users to see.\nFeature: Color Control for Raster Layers ¶ QGIS 2.0 allows you to precisely control exactly how you'd like raster layers to appear. You now have complete control over the brightness, contrast and saturation of raster layers. There's even options to allow display of rasters in grayscale or by colorising with a specified color.\nFeature: Copy symbology between layers ¶ Its now super easy to copy symbology from one layer to another layer. If you are working with several similar layer, you can simply right-click on one layer, choose Copy Style from the context menu and then right-click on another layer and choose Paste-Style.\nFeature: Save styles in your database ¶ If you are using a database vector data store, you can now store the layer style definitions directly in the database. This makes it easy to share styled layers in an enterprise or multi-user environment.\nFeature: Colour ramp support ¶ Colour ramps are now available in many places in QGIS symbology settings and QGIS ships with a rich, extensible set of colour ramps. You can also design your own and many cpt-city themes are included in QGIS now 'out of the box'. Color ramps even have full support for transparency!\nFeature: Set custom default styles for all layer types ¶ Now QGIS lets you control how new layers will be drawn when they do not have an existing .qml style defined. You can also set the default transparency level for new layers and whether symbols should have random colours assigned to them.\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: New icon theme ¶ We have updated out icon theme to use the 'GIS' theme which introduces an improved level of consistency and professionalism to the QGIS user interface.\nFeature: Side tabs, collapsable groups ¶ We have standardised the layout of tabs and introduced collapsible group boxes into many of our dialogs to make navigating the various options more easy, and to make better use of screen real estate.\nFeature: Soft notifications ¶ In many cases we want to tell you something, but we don't want to stop your work or get in your way. With the new notification system QGIS can let you know about important information via a yellow message bar that appears at the top of the map canvas but doesn't force you to deal with it if you are busy doing something else. Programmers can create these notification (e.g. from a plugin) too using our python API.\nFeature: Application custom font and Qt stylesheet ¶ The system font used for the application's user interface can now be set. Any C++ or Python plugin that is a child of the QGIS GUI application or has copied/applied the application's GUI stylesheet can inherit its styling, which is useful for GUI fixes across platforms and when using custom QGIS Qt widgets, like QgsCollapsibleGroupBox.\nThe generated QGIS GUI application stylesheet for the current platform can be accessed after launching with (in PyQGIS):\nqgis.utils.iface.mainWindow().styleSheet() Feature: Live color chooser dialogs and buttons ¶ Every color chooser button throughout the interface has been updated to give visual feedback on whether the current color has a transparent, or 'alpha,' component. The color chooser opened by the new color buttons will now always be the default for the operating system. If the user has Use live-updating color chooser dialogs checked under Options -\u0026gt; General -\u0026gt; Application, any change in the color chooser will immediately be shown in the color button and for any item currently being edited, where applicable.\nFeature: SVG Annotations ¶ With QGIS 2.0 you can now add SVG annotations to your map - either pinned to a specific place or in a relative position over the map canvas.\nFeature: Drag and drop form builder ¶ QGIS 2.0 supports a great new system for creating data entry forms. With the drag and drop form designer you can create smart looking forms with tabs to group common fields together. Now it is much easier to control the data entry experience for your users.\nFeature: Default action tool ¶ If you are a user of vector layer actions (small tasks that can run when you click on a feature), you will love the new action tool on the toolbar. With it you can select an active action and then click on your features to invoke that action.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog200/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 2.0"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 2.10 ¶ Release date: 2015-06-26\nThis is the change log for the next release of QGIS - version 2.10.0 ' Pisa' - host city to our developer meet up in March 2010.\nLatest Release\nThis is the next release in our 4-monthly release series. It gives you early access to the new features we have been working on and represents the 'cutting edge' of QGIS development. If you are working in a production environment where you wish to be more conservative about rolling out new features to your users, we also provide a Long Term Release (LTR) version of QGIS. The current LTR is version 2.8.2 and is available at download.qgis.org. LTR releases will be supported with backported bug fixes for one year, and will be in permanent feature freeze (i.e. no new features will be added, only bug fixes and trivial updates). The features provided in QGIS 2.10 'Pisa' will be included in the next LTR release (slated for release in 2016), so using this release provides you with an excellent opportunity to test new features that will make their way into the next LTR.\nNew Features in QGIS 2.10 'Pisa'\nQGIS 2.10.0 includes many great new features, tweaks and enhancements to make the most popular Free desktop GIS even more feature filled and useful. Whenever new features are added to software they introduce the possibility of new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker.\nThanks\nWe would like to thank the developers, documenters, testers and all the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so).\nFrom the QGIS community we hope you enjoy this release!

Prior to this change one had to delete and recreate the whole join.\nFeature: Layers with joins can now be filtered ¶ Prior to version 2.10 a layer couldn't be filtered if it had at least one join. Now it is still filterable, but only using columns of the original master table.\nFeature: General improvements ¶ As well as the numerous items listed below, the following improvements have been made:\nSupport for Pointcloud layers in PostGIS Improved icon bars and icons in dockable widgets to occupy less screen real estate and for improved OSX appearance Improvements to the GRASS plugin / provider Support for non-latin scripts for curved labels Greatly improved and more robust raster calculator and georeferencer tools Improved UI and workflow for the data defined label properties window Feature: Improved handling of potential project file overwrites ¶ QGIS 2.10 will now warn you when attempting to save you project if last modification date of a loaded project has changed. This is useful if more than one user or session has the same project file open and are both attempting to save edits to the project file.\nThis feature was developed by: Jürgen Fischer (norBIT)\nFeature: New geometry engine ¶ QGIS 2.10 has a new geometry engine. In general you won't see many differences on the user interface yet, but this lays the foundation for a much richer set of geospatial capabilities that we will be able to support in the future. The new implementation supports curved geometry types (so for example you can represent a traffic roundabout as a circle rather than a segmented polygon made to look like a circle) and has backend support for z/m values in geometries. To use curves in QGIS you will need to use PostGIS or a similar datastore that is able to express curvilinear geometries. If you want to have a play you can try a simple exercise like this in your PostGIS database:\n-- Table: curves DROP TABLE curves; CREATE TABLE curves ( id bigserial NOT NULL, geometry geometry(CURVEPOLYGON, 4326), name text, CONSTRAINT p_key PRIMARY KEY (id) ); INSERT INTO curves VALUES ( 1, st_geomfromtext( 'CURVEPOLYGON(CIRCULARSTRING(1 1,1 2, 2 2, 2 1, 1 1))', 4326), 'test'); Then add the layer curves to your project.\nThis feature was developed by: Marco Hugentobler (Sourcepole AG)\nThis feature was funded by: KantonSolothurn, Switzerland\nAnalysis tools ¶ Feature: New statistical summary dock widget ¶ Can display summary statistics (e.g. mean, standard deviation, ...) for a field or expression from a vector layer or selection. This is provided by means of a new dock panel that you can activate from the View -\u0026gt; Panels -\u0026gt; Statistics menu. Please note that you will only be able to generate statistics on vector layers that have a numeric column.\nFeature: Use logarithmic functions in the raster calculator ¶ The raster calculator (Raster -\u0026gt; Raster Calculator in the QGIS menu) is a tool that allows you to perform matrix operations on one or more raster layers. With QGIS 2.10 you can now use LN and LOG10 functions in the raster calculator.\nFeature: New zonal statistics features ¶ Zonal statistics provide a way to extract aggregate values for the pixels underlying a polygon. The following new features have been added to our zonal statistics tool:\nyou can now select which statistics to calculate extra statistics have been added (median, standard dev, min, max, range, minority, majority and variety) ability to select the raster band to use for statistics extraction Note that zonal stats is a 'core plugin' (a plugin that ships with your QGIS installer), but is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the plugin manager and then a menu entry for zonal statistics will appear in the Raster menu.\nBrowser ¶ Feature: New browser properties widget ¶ When using the QGIS Browser dock panels (View -\u0026gt; Panels -\u0026gt; Browser), you and now enable a properties widget at the bottom of the file system tree. Any data source that you click on will have its properties shown in this panel. This makes it quick and convenient to see basic information about the dataset you have selected. To toggle the properties view, you should use the i icon at the top of the browser panel.\nFeature: New browser icon ¶ The QGIS Browser is a separate, standalone application that allows you to browse and view the GIS datasets available to you (from your file system, database connections, web service connections etc.) In previous releases of QGIS we used a very similar icon to the QGIS application itself which has been the source of confusion for many users. In order to reduce the likeliness of opening the wrong application, we have created a new icon for QGIS Browser.\nData Providers ¶ Feature: DXF Export Improvements ¶ The DXF export was continuously improved in the last three QGIS versions. This version introduces an improved SVG or simple marker to DXF block conversion, fixes a few bugs and issues that resulted in incomplete (unreadable) DXF files. In the Screenshot you can see the original view in QGIS on the left and the rendering of the exported DXF file in Autodesk TrueView on the right.\nSee also this article on qgis.ch explaining what is supported and what not.\nThis feature was developed by: Jürgen Fischer (norBIT)\nThis feature was funded by: Communities of Morges, Uster, Vevey and SIGE\nFeature: PostGIS provider side expression filters ¶ In QGIS 2.10 you can now filter features on the database server side. Only supported expressions will be sent to the database. Expressions using unsupported operators or functions will gracefully fallback to local evaluation.\nTo make use of this feature you need to enable it in Settings -\u0026gt; Options -\u0026gt; data sources. If your filter expression is PostgreSQL compliant it will automatically be run on the server side. You can also make use of this feature when using the python API for example when using these calls.\nQgsFeatureRequest().setFilterExpression( expression )\nor\nQgsVectorLayer::getFeatures( expression )\nData management ¶ Feature: Virtual fields are now updatable ¶ Prior to version 2.8 you had to delete and recreate virtual fields if you wanted to change the expression for calculating the virtual field. In 2.10 you can now go to the Fields tab and press the small Expression button to open the expression editor and update the expression used for the virtual field.\nThis feature was developed by: Matthias Kuhn (OpenGIS)\nThis feature was funded by: City of Uster, Switzerland\nFeature: Line edit with auto-completer for ValueRelation edit widget ¶ The value relation edit widget for vector layers (Layer -\u0026gt; Properties -\u0026gt; Fields -\u0026gt; Edit Widget -\u0026gt; Value Relation) can now be set to autocomplete as you start typing in the input box it creates on the feature form.\nFeature: Improvements to DB Manager ¶ There are two new features in the DB Manager :\nQuery as layer does not need a unique integer column anymore\nA column with unique integer column is not needed anymore to load an SQL query as a QGIS layer. An auto-incremented value will be used in place.\nIntegration of an SQL query builder\nA new window in DB Manager helps the creation of SQL queries by means of widgets where table names, column names and functions can be selected by the user. It has been ported from the QSpatialite plugin and works for PostGIS and Spatialite providers.\nThese features were funded by: MEDDE (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)\nThese features were developed by: Hugo Mercier / Oslandia\nFeature: Filter chaining for relation reference widget ¶ To select linked entries from other tables one can use the relation reference widgets. One can either select elements graphically by selecting them in the map, if the linked feature has a geometry attached or choose an element by the linked id. To facilitate the non-spatial selection it is now possible to narrow the available options with filters (chained or unchained). If the filters are unchained their choices are combined with \u0026quot;AND\u0026quot; to define the available options. If chained is checked, a drill-down mode for the filters is activated so each filter only shows the entries which correspond to the previous filter. This is useful for selecting from hierarchical data like City -\u0026gt; Street -\u0026gt; Number.\nThis feature was developed by: Matthias Kuhn (OpenGIS)\nThis feature was funded by: SIGE\nDiagrams ¶ Feature: Diagram improvements ¶ The diagram functionality in QGIS allows you to overlay small pie charts or histograms over features on the map. In this release we have made the following improvements to diagramming support:\nDiagrams can be disabled without losing settings Add checkbox to always show diagrams for a layer Diagrams user interface has been refreshed to simplify the dialog and make it more user friendly Diagram classes are now shown in the layer's legend Digitising ¶ Feature: Improved geometry rotation tool ¶ The geometry rotation tool is an advanced digitising tool that allows you to arbitrarily rotate a feature's geometry. The following improvements have been made to the rotation tool:\nyou can now use numerical input in rotation map tool you can use a combo box to set the angles added support for snapping to angles (directly enabled when usingshift + click``) rotation anchor is defined on CTRL+click and not on mouse move Labelling ¶ Feature: \u0026quot;Follow point\u0026quot; alignment for multiline labels ¶ When set to this mode, text alignment for labels are dependent on the final placement of the label relative to the point. Eg, if the label is placed to the left of the point then the label will be right aligned, and if it is placed to the right of the point then the label will be left aligned. This greatly improves the appearance of multiline labels for point layers.\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: Add scalebar sizing mode to fit a desired scalebar width ¶ In previous QGISversions it was hard to use graphical scalebars when the range of potential scales was big. The scalebar would either be quickly too wide or too narrow and one had to manually adapt the segment sizes (units per segment) after each scale change. It also meant that graphical scalebars couldn't be really used in Atlas serial printing or with QGISserver when the final map scale was unknown. With QGIS2.10 one can now set min/max sizes for one segment length in mm and QGISwould automatically adapt the units per segment while still keeping round values.\nDon't forget to also set the alignment of the scalebar, esp. if you want it to be centered or right-aligned!\nThis feature was developed by: Sandro Mani (Sourcepole AG)\nThis feature was funded by: Kanton Glarus, Switzerland\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Improvements for programmers ¶ We have made a number of changes and improvements that will be of interest to developers:\nWe have upped the minimum requirement for Qt4 to version 4.8. Qt4 is one of the main C++ toolkits / libraries we use to create QGIS. New QgsStatisticalSummary class for calculating statistics from a list of numbers. Allow changing vector layer data source. Implicit sharing of classes : QgsField, QgsFields, QgsDataDefined, QgsFeature, QgsGeometry. Plugins can now create their own entries in the browser widget with two new classes : QgsDataItemProvider and QgsDataItemProviderRegistry. QGIS Server ¶ Feature: Support for tolerance parameter in WMS GetFeatureInfo requests ¶ When using WMS layers served by QGIS Server, you can now specify the tolerance for how far from the click origin GetFeatureInfo requests should be considered. This is important for mobile devices where it is harder to exactly point to features. Before this new feature, it was practically impossible to identify point or line features on a mobile device with QGIS server. You can add the following parameters to your GetFeatureInfo requests:\nFI_POINT_TOLERANCE=16\u0026amp;FI_LINE_TOLERANCE=8\u0026amp;FI_POLYGON_TOLERANCE=4\nand change the tolerance values (in pixels) to suit your needs.\nThis feature was developed by: Marco Hugentobler (Sourcepole AG)\nThis feature was funded by: City of Uster, Switzerland\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Match categories to existing styles ¶ Add options under categorised renderer advanced menu to set categories to symbols with a matching name from the style library or an XML style file.\nFeature: Vary symbol sizes using the graduated renderer ¶ Renderers are the subsystem of QGIS that allow you to create rich cartographical representations of your data. A graduated renderer varies the symbology based on a continuously changing value in a vector layer. In previous versions of QGIS you could only vary the colour (e.g. by using a colour along a colour ramp). In QGIS 2.10, the graduated symbol renderer now allows you to to vary size or the colour. For point layers you can vary the point size, for lines you can vary the line width. Polygon layers retain only the ability to vary by colour, line width is not yet supported.\nThis feature was developed by: Vincent Mora (Oslandia)\nThis feature was funded by: Agence de l'eau Adour-Garonne\nFeature: New option for preventing the automatic clipping of features to the map extent ¶ This option (located under the symbol advanced menu) disables the automatic clipping of lines/polygons to the canvas extent. In some cases this clipping results in unfavourable symbology (eg centroid fills where the centroid must always be the actual feature's centroid).\nFeature: Size scale and rotation have been removed from the advanced menu ¶ We have removed SizeScale and Rotation from `Layer -\u0026gt; Properties -\u0026gt; Symbology tab -\u0026gt; Advanced Menu. You should rather set rotation on a per-symbol layer basis using an expression or field. The expressions used in old projects are converted to symbol level data defined size and angle properties.\nThis feature was developed by: Vincent Mora (Oslandia)\nThis feature was funded by: Agence de l'eau Adour-Garonne\nFeature: Data defined properties for font marker ¶ Most properties of the font marker can now be data defined, including marker size, rotation and character.\nFeature: Visualise and modify the graduated renderer using a histogram ¶ A new histogram tab has been added to the graduated renderer, which shows an interactive histogram of the values from the assigned field or expression. Class breaks can be moved or added using the histogram.\nThis feature was funded by: ADUGA\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Size, rotation and stroke-width expressions at the symbollist level ¶ Size and Rotation can be defined by an expression for all symbol levels composing a marker. Width can be defined by an expression for all symbols composing a line.\nFor symbols, a legend is generated for varying sizes. This allows multivariate analysis legend in the case of classified/graduated colors.\nAn assistant, with preview, is accessible through the data defined button to help the user define the size expression. Three methods are available: Flannery, Area and Radius.\nThis feature was developed by: Vincent Mora (Oslandia)\nThis feature was funded by: Agence de l'eau Adour-Garonne\nFeature: Live layer effects for layers and symbol layers ¶ Live layer effects add to the already extensive cartographic capabilities of QGIS by adding the ability to add various render effects into the render chain. With live effects you can do things like placing drop shadows under your symbol, skewing and shearing the rendered symbol. You can also layer these effects one on top of each other and set whether the effect should be progressive (i.e. apply itself to the rendered state thus far) or discrete (by re-injecting the source geometry back into the render chain).\nNote: This is functionality for advanced users and we should note that overuse of this feature can significantly slow down render times, so you may want to consider having different symbology profiles for your layer - one for generation of production quality maps and one for draft mode.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nThis feature was funded by: a crowd-funding initiative\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog210/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 2.10"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 2.12 ¶ Release date: 2015-10-23\nThis is the change log for the next release of QGIS - version 2.12.0 'Lyon' - host city to our developer meet up in April 2012.\nNew Features in QGIS 2.12 'Lyon'\nThis is the next release in our 4-monthly release series.

Automated code scans using Coverity Scan have been regularly used to identify potential issues, and our Coverity defect density is now impressively low at just 0.02 defects per 1000 lines of code. The library of automated unit tests has also grown significantly during 2.12, resulting in more regressions being identified and fixed immediately. In 2.12 we also added continuous testing on OSX, so that every commit is tested against the unit test suite on both Linux and OSX platforms.\nFeature: Advanced settings editor ¶ A new panel has been added to the settings dialog that lets you edit any of the options already defined in your your profile. This is intended for power users only as you could experience unexpected behaviour in QGIS if you change these settings without fully understanding what you are doing.\nThis feature was developed by: Matthias Kuhn at OpenGIS\nFeature: Mutually exclusive layer tree groups ¶ With this feature, you can create layer groups where only one layer in the group may be visible at any time. The feature can be toggled individually for groups in layer tree view context menu.\nThis feature was developed by: Martin Dobias at Lutra Consulting on subcontract to Gis3W\nThis feature was funded by: Tuscany Region (Italy) - SITA (CIG: 63526840AE)\nFeature: Filtering for field values in expression widget ¶ When creating an expression that uses values from a field, you can now filter the field values preview panel.\nThis feature was developed by: Salvatore Larosa\nFeature: User Interface Theme support ¶ QGIS 2.12 now supports user interface theming support which you can use to customise the appearance of window backgrounds, buttons etc. By default we ship with two themes: Default and Night mapping. The latter is a dark theme which some people may prefer if they find that light themes cause eye strain. If you know a little CSS you can create your own custom themes fairly easily too...\nFind out more about theming support by reading Nathan Woodrow's blog article.\nThis feature was developed by: Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: New expression functions in 2.12 ¶ A set of functions for \u0026quot;fuzzy matching\u0026quot; have been added. These include functions for finding the similarity of two strings and also for performing phonetic matching between strings, and allow you to perform filters for records which \u0026quot;nearly match\u0026quot; a specified string.\nMore geometry based functions have been added, including:\nnum_points(geom) for calculating the number of nodes in a geometry area(geom), length(geom) and perimeter(geom), for calculating the area, length and perimeter of any geometry object. Previously only calculation of the area, length and perimeter of the current feature's geometry was possible. start_point(geom), end_point(geom), point_n(geom, n), for retrieving the first, last and numbered points from a geometry make_point(x,y), for manual creation of a point geometry x(geom), y(geom) functions which return the x and y coordinate for point geometries or the centroid x/y for non-point geometries A new project_color function has been added, which allows you to retrieve a color from the project's color scheme by name. This lets you create 'linked colors', where the color of symbol or labeling components can be bound to a color in the project's color scheme. Update the color in the scheme, and all the linked colors will be automatically refreshed to match!\nAdditionally, some very useful expressions have been ported from the expressions+ plugin, including:\ncolor_part: allows retreival of a specific color component (eg red, hue, alpha) from a color set_color_part: allows a specific color component to be overridden, eg alter the alpha value (opacity) of a color day_of_week: returns the day of week as a number from a date Additionally, the context help for expression functions has been improved for better readability.\nFeature: Variables in expressions ¶ You can now define custom variables for use in expressions. Variables can be defined at the application global level, project level, layer level and composition level. Just like CSS cascading rules, variables can be overwritten - eg, a project level variable will overwrite any application level variables set. You can use these variables to build text strings or other custom expressions. For example in composer creating a label with this content:\nThis map was made using QGIS [% @qgis_version %]. The project file for this map is: [% @project_path %]\nWill render the label like this:\nThis map was made using QGIS 2.12. The project file for this map is: /gis/qgis-user-conference-2015.qgs\nYou can manage global variables from the Settings -\u0026gt; Options menu, and project level variables from Project properties (including adding your own custom variables).\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nAnalysis tools ¶ Feature: Added number of vertices to derived fields in identify tool ¶ Using the identify tool on a line feature will now show the number of vertices in the feature as an additional derived attribute.\nFeature: Raster alignment tool ¶ This new tool in qgis_analysis library is able to take several rasters as input and:\nreproject to the same CRS resample to the same cell size and offset in the grid clip to a region of interest rescale values when required This feature was developed by: Martin Dobias at Lutra Consulting on subcontract to Kartoza\nThis feature was funded by: DFAT for the InaSAFE project\nFeature: Geometry Checker and Geometry Snapper plugins ¶ Two new plugins (which you need to manually enable in the plugin manager) are available for validating and correcting geometries. The Geometry Checker plugin (pictured right) will check and correct your vector dataset for a number of different types of systematic errors and attempt to resolve them for you. After resolving an error, the error list is automatically updated so that if, for example, fixing one error also resolves other errors, all the errors are removed from the issue list.\nWith the Geometry Snapper tool you can align the edges and vertices of one vector layer to the edges and vertices of a second layer using a user defined tolerance.\nThis feature was developed by: Sandro Mani at Sourcepole AG\nThis feature was funded by: Canton of Solothurn\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Encrypted password management ¶ QGIS 2.12 introduces a new authentication system (see PR 2330, QEP 14). Here's what is included:\nMaster-password-encrypted authentication configurations stored in an SQLite database Authentication method plugin architecture (like data providers) Basic auth method plugin Basic plugin integrated with PostGIS and OWS provider connections Inline with current username/password setup (still fully functional) SSL server connection configurations (save exceptions or custom configs for SSL connection errors) PKI authentication related:\nImport extra Certificate Authorities, intermediate cert issuers and personal identity bundles Manage certificate components like in Firefox Authentication method plugins for PEM and PKCS#12 bundles on disk, and for stored personal identities Integrated with OWS provider connections (PostGIS and other databases will take a bit more work) For shared project scenarios, including a network drive setup, you can edit the authentication configuration (authcfg) ID to something that is shared across users.\nSince the authcfg ID is embedded in the project file, each user just needs to make an auth config that has their specific credentials for that resource, then edit the ID (upon creation of config or after) to the same ID in the project file. Then, when the resource loads, the same configuration will be queried on everyone's QGIS, just with their respective credentials for the authentication method used.\nFor the Handle Bad Layers dialog, users can Add/Edit/Remove auth configs within the dialog and have the data source URI updated to match. So, in the scenario of a shared project, the user could immediately add an appropriate new auth config (and see exactly what shared authcfg ID should be used) upon project loading .\nCurrently, the master password auto-set can be set via Python, or by way of a custom C++ plugin, on launch setups using a call to QgsAuthManager::instance()-\u0026gt;setMasterPassword( \u0026quot;mypassword\u0026quot;, true ), or by QGIS_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE environment variable to set the path to a file with the master password.\nNote: for Server, you can also use QGIS_AUTH_DB_DIR_PATH to set the path to a qgis-auth.db directory and QGIS_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE to set the path to a file with the master password on the server.\nPKI example docs: https://github.com/dakcarto/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/blob/auth-system/extras/auth-system/pkiuser.rst\nThis feature was developed by: Larry Shaffer\nThis feature was funded by: Boundless Spatial, Inc.\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Improvements to PostGIS connections in browser ¶ The QGIS browser now supports additional functionality for PostGIS connections, including the ability to create, rename and delete schemas, support for renaming and truncating layers and to copy tables from one schema to an other.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nTable copying by: Jürgen Fischer at norBIT GmbH\nData Providers ¶ Feature: PostGIS provider improvements ¶ The following improvements were made to the PostGIS provider:\nperformance improvements for rule based renderer for PostGIS layers added support for compound keys on views Compound keys developed by: Jürgen Fischer at norBIT GmbH\nData management ¶ Feature: DBManager Improvements ¶ There have been a number of improvements to the DB Manager tool:\nIn the DB Manager you can now export your data to any OGR supported data format instead of the Shapefile only that was available in the previous version. Oracle Spatial is now supported in the DBManager When importing data into a table you can use the new import only selected features option to restrict what will be imported. New query windows are now created as tabs to reduce the number of dialogs Feature: Conditional formatting for attribute table cells ¶ This is a major improvement to QGIS's attribute table rendering support. You can now style table cells according to rules. For example you can colour all cells with a population of less than 50 000 in red. The option is enabled via a new icon on the table toolbar at the top right of the attribute table window. You can read more about this feature on Nathan Woodrow's blog article.\nThis feature was developed by: Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: Support for relative paths in widgets ¶ For the following edit widget types:\nFile Name Photo Web View If the path which is selected with the file browser is located in the same directory as the .qgs project file or below, paths are converted to relative paths. This increases portability of a QGIS project with multimedia information attached.\nThis feature was developed by: Matthias Kuhn at OpenGIS\nThis feature was funded by: Alta ehf\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Digitising improvements ¶ In QGIS 2.10 we mentioned that there is a new geometry architecture for QGIS but that not all features were supported in the digitising tools. With QGIS 2.12 we now have editing support for the creation of curves / 'circular strings`. Note again that you need to be using a data provider (e.g. PostGIS, GML or WFS) that supports curves. These improvements to the digitising tools were also added in QGIS 2.12:\ntool to add circular strings with two points and radius tool to add circular strings with start point, curve point and end point allow escape to cancel drawing new features display a node table when editing using node tool, allowing you to manually enter the exact x and y coordinates for nodes, as well as the z and m values (depending on layer type) Additionally, more of the geometry editing and modification tools were updated to work correctly with layers containing z or m dimensions.\nThis feature was developed by: Marco Hugentobler at Sourcepole AG\nThis feature was funded by: Canton of Solothurn\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Data defined quadrant when in \u0026quot;around point\u0026quot; mode ¶ Its now possible to specify a data defined quadrant when a point label is set to the Around Point placement mode. This allows you to manually override the quadrant placement for a specific label while allowing the remaining labels to fall back to automatic placement.\nSee this article for more details.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Draw only labels which fit inside polygons ¶ An option has been added to polygon layers to only draw labels which fit completely within polygon features.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Control priority of labeling obstacles ¶ In 2.12 it's now possible to specify the priority for labeling obstacles. This allows you to make labels prefer to overlap features from certain layers rather than others. The priority can also be data defined so that certain features are more likely to be covered than others. You can also use data defined expressions or fields to control whether a specific feature in layer will act as an obstacle for labels.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New options to control how polygon layers act as obstacles ¶ New options have been added to control how labels should be placed to avoid overlapping the features in polygon layers. The options are to either avoid placing labels over polygon interiors or avoid placing them over polygon boundaries. Avoiding placing labels over boundaries is useful for regional boundary layers, where the features cover an entire area. In this case it's impossible to avoid placing labels within these features and it looks much better to avoid placing them over the boundaries between features instead. The result is better cartographic placement of labels in this situation.\nSee this article for more details.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Data defined control over label priority ¶ This often-requested feature allows users to set the priority for individual labels. In past releases QGIS allowed setting the label priority for an entire layer, but there was no option to control the priority of features within a layer. Now, you can use a data defined expression or field to prioritize labeling certain features over others within a layer!\nSee this article for more details\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Option for obstacle-only layers ¶ This allows users to set a layer as just an obstacle for other layer's labels without rendering any labels of its own. It means that a non-labelled layer can act as an obstacle for the labels in other layers, so they will be discouraged from drawing labels over the features in the obstacle layer, and allows for improved automatic label placement by preventing overlap of labels and features from other layers.\nIn the screenshot you can see that the Streets have the option \u0026quot;Discourage other labels from covering features in this layer\u0026quot; enabled. The red labels derived from polygon geometries are thus placed to avoid intersection with the street axis. You have to enable \u0026quot;Horizontal\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Free\u0026quot; on the polygon layer in order to achieve proper results.\nNote, that it is also possible to both label a layer, but also act as obstacle layer, by enabling the checkbox \u0026quot;Discourage labels from covering features\u0026quot; in the \u0026quot;rendering\u0026quot; tab of the label settings.\nSee this article for more details.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Rule-based labeling ¶ Labels on features can now be styled using rules to add even more control over placement and styling of labels. Just like the rule based cartographic rendering, label rules can be nested to allow for extremely flexible styling options. For example you can render labels differently based on the size of the feature they will be rendered into (as illustrated in the screenshot).\nSee blogpost for more details\nThis feature was developed by: Martin Dobias at Lutra Consulting on subcontract to Gis3W\nThis feature was funded by: Tuscany Region (Italy) - SITA (CIG: 63526840AE)\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: Atlas navigation improvements ¶ You can now set a field or expression as the \u0026quot;page name\u0026quot; for atlas compositions. A page number combobox has been added to the atlas toolbar, which shows both a list of available page numbers and names. This allows you to jump directly to a specific page within your atlas.\nThe page name can also be used within symbology and labeling expressions to allow advanced styling of atlas features based on their page name.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Custom format for grid annotations ¶ Composer map grid annotations can now be formatted in custom formats, which are evaluated using the expression engine. Now you utilise whatever esoteric grid numbering format your maps require!\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Multiline text handling and automatic text wrapping in composer attribute tables ¶ Composer attribute tables now include full support for multi line strings. Control over the vertical alignment of text within a cell has also been added, along with options for wrapping text on certain characters or automatically calculating text wrapping to fit the size of columns. To enforce automatic text wrapping with automatic row heights, set the column width to a fixed size.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nThis feature was funded by: City of Uster\nFeature: Advanced customisation of cell background color ¶ This change allows users to set differing colors for alternating rows and columns, first/last row/column and header row within composer attribute tables.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nThis feature was funded by: Ville de Morges\nFeature: Add fit page to contents option and options for cropping exports to contents ¶ A new option has been added in the composition panel to resize a composition to its contents, with optional extra margins if required.\nComposer exports can also be cropped to their contents. If selected, this option will make the images output by composer include only the area of the composition with content. There's also an option for margins to add around the item bounds if required.\nIf the composition includes a single page, then the output will be sized to include EVERYTHING on the composition. If it's a multi-page composition, then each page will be cropped to only include the area of that page with items.\nA new image export options dialog has been added to facilitate this, which also includes handy shortcuts for overriding the print resolution or exported image dimensions.\nSponsored by: NIWA\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Force vector layers to render as a raster images ¶ A new option has been added under the layer properties, rendering tab to force a vector layer to render as a raster. Extremely detailed layers (eg polygon layers with a huge number of nodes) can cause composer exports in PDF/SVG format to be huge as all nodes are included in the exported file. This can also make the resultant file very slow to work with or open in external programs. Now, you can force these layers to be rasterised on a layer-by-layer basis, so that the exported files won't have to include all the nodes contained in these layers. The end result is smaller file sizes and PDFs/SVGs which are faster to open.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Data defined control over map layers and style presets ¶ A new data defined control has been added for the map layers and style presets to show in a composer map. The map layers data defined expression should result in a | (pipe) delimited list of layer names which will be shown in the map, or the style preset data defined expression should result in the name of an existing style preset.\nUsing this control over map layers allows for \u0026quot;layer-based\u0026quot; atlases, where the map layers should change between atlas pages instead of or in combination with the map extent changing. An example could be an atlas looping over different administrative units and at the same time looping over several historic maps or aerial images.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nThis feature was funded by: City of Uster\nFeature: Option to hide pages from view/export ¶ There's now an option to hide the display of pages while editing and exporting compositions. This option is useful for compositions which aren't intended for print and are not bound by any preset page sizes. You can hide the pages, then add and resize items in any way you desire without the visual distraction of page boundaries!\nSponsored by: NIWA\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Update of the GRASS plugin ¶ The GRASS plugin was updated to enable support for GRASS 7. GRASS layers can be browsed and loaded from the QGIS browser or browser panel. GRASS vector data can be edited directly within QGIS. The project contains the following work packages:\nPlugin library upgrade and multi version build QGIS browser and browser panel integration Support for mapsets, modules and shell to allow data analysis vector editing For both GRASS 6 and GRASS 7 users you will find that the integration between GRASS and QGIS is much more seamless. You can create GRASS layers directly in the QGIS Browser panel, style GRASS vector layers using standard QGIS styling tools and use familiar QGIS digitising tools to create new vector geometries in a GRASS mapset.\nSee also QGIS GRASS Plugin Upgrade project page and progress report\nThis feature was developed by: Radim Blazek\nThis feature was funded by: Crowd funding, see project page\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Map tools moved from app-\u0026gt;gui ¶ This change allows reuse of map tools from within PyQGIS scripts and Python plugins.\nThis feature was developed by: Matthias Kuhn at OpenGIS\nThis feature was funded by: SIGE\nFeature: Editing layers via `with edit(layer):` ¶ Example:\nfrom qgis.core import edit with edit(layer): f=layer.getFeatures().next() f[0]=5 layer.updateFeature(f) This will automatically call commitChanges() in the end. If any exception occurs, it will rollBack() all the changes.\nThis feature was developed by: Matthias Kuhn at OpenGIS\nFeature: New API for labeling engine (QgsLabelingEngineV2) ¶ The idea is to make the engine more flexible compared to QgsPalLabeling implementation:\nabstract dealing with text labels / diagrams from the engine itself allow multiple types of labels per layer support custom label providers (e.g. implemented by plugins) make the labeling engine independent from map rendering engine make it easier to auto-test the labeling engine and its components See blogpost for more details\nThis feature was developed by: Martin Dobias at Lutra Consulting on subcontract to Gis3W\nThis feature was funded by: Tuscany Region (Italy) - SITA (CIG: 63526840AE)\nFeature: Open scripts in external editor ¶ Pythonistas rejoice - you can now open your scripts in an external editor using the new button added to the console.\nThis feature was developed by: Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: New classes for PyQGIS programs ¶ A new class QgsStringUtils has been added which allows PyQGIS scripts to utilise the new fuzzy matching algorithms added in 2.12. These include functions for finding the Levenshtein edit distance between two strings and for calculating the soundex phonetic representation of a string. These algorithms have been highly optimized for performance, so they are ready for you to start fuzzy matching across millions of strings!\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: QGIS Server Python API ¶ QGIS Server is now packed as a library with an initial (but growing) API and Python bindings. With the new API we have a set of Python tests for the server main component and for the server plugins. Invoking the server from Python is now as easy as:\nfrom qgis.server import QgsServer headers, body = QgsServer().handleRequest(my_query_string) For more information see this article\nThis work has been developed and funded by: Alessandro Pasotti at ItOpen\nFeature: getMap in dxf format ¶ It is now possible to retrieve the result of a GetMap WMS request in DXF format. It supports the same features and options as available in QGIS desktop. With the same limitations.\n| Sample URL: | http://yourserver.org/cgi-bin/qgismapserver.fcgi? | map=/path/to/your/projectfile.qgs\u0026amp; | SERVICE=WMS\u0026amp; | VERSION=1.3.0\u0026amp; | REQUEST=GetMAP\u0026amp; | FORMAT=application/dxf\u0026amp; | FORMAT_OPTIONS=SCALE:500;MODE:SYMBOLLAYERSYMBOLOGY\u0026amp; | FILE_NAME=youroutputfilename.dxf\u0026amp; | CRS=EPSG:EPSG:21781\u0026amp; | BBOX=695558.73070825,244430.77224034,697158.88528251,245722.25976142\u0026amp; | WIDTH=1042\u0026amp; | HEIGHT=841\u0026amp; | LAYERS=yourdxfexportlayers\nSee also QGIS as OGC data server for all the available options.\nIn the screenshot you see QGIS Web Client on the left with the DXF export functionality (utilizing QGIS server) and the same extent viewed in Autodesk TrueView on the right.\nThis feature was developed by: Marco Hugentobler Sourcepole AG\nThis feature was funded by: City of Uster\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Export thumbnails from style manager ¶ Style manager now allows you to export selected style thumbnails as either SVG or PNG images.\nThis feature was developed by: Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: New option for limiting size in mm when using map unit sizes ¶ Previously only the option to limit the scale range of the map unit sizes was available. Now you can also choose to limit the corresponding rendered size in mm.\nFeature: Improvements to displacement renderer ¶ Allow tolerance in mm/pixels for displacement renderer Allow setting transparency for colors Concentric ring placement mode (allows for more compact display than only with rings) This feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\nFeature: All color ramps can now be edited ¶ In QGIS 2.12 \u0026quot;edit\u0026quot; buttons have been added next to every color ramp choice. This allows you to easily edit an existing color ramp without having to create a new ramp and overwrite the existing one.\nFeature: Improved handling of SVG marker outlines ¶ QGIS 2.12 fixes a number of issues regarding the handling of outlines within SVG marker and SVG fill symbols.\nPrevious versions of QGIS would render the outlines at a significantly smaller size than set, and drawing SVGs with outline sizes in map units was broken.\nThese issues have been fixed in QGIS 2.12, but as a result you may need to update your project symbology if you've previously set oversized outlines for your symbols to overcome these bugs. In the image you see QGIS 2.12 vs QGIS 2.10 SVG markers in the symbol layer dialogs.\nFeature: Add pixels as option for all symbology size unit choices ¶ For all size input widgets there is now a third option \u0026quot;pixel\u0026quot;, next to \u0026quot;mm\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;map units\u0026quot;. This concerns symbol sizes, stroke widths, dash sizes, offsets, etc. This may help, if you design for screens and not for print output.\nThis feature was developed by: Nyall Dawson\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog212/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 2.12"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 2.14 ¶ Release date: 2016-02-26\nThis is the changelog for the next release of QGIS - version 2.14 'Essen'. Essen was the host city to our developer meet ups in October 2012 and 2014.\nLong Term Release\nThis is a special release since it is designated an 'LTR' (Long Term Release). LTR releases will be supported with backported bug fixes for one year, and will be in permanent feature freeze (i.e. no new features will be added, only bug fixes and trivial updates). Note that we are in discussion to extend the term of our LTR releases to two years, but for technical reasons we will not do this until QGIS 3.2.\nThe purpose of LTR releases is to provide a stable and less frequently changing platform for enterprises and organizations that do not want to deal with updating user skills, training materials etc. more than once per year. The success of the LTR is very much down to you, our beloved users - we need your support to help funding bug fixes and making sure in your support contracts with support providers specify that any bug fixes done on your behalf are applied to the LTR branch as well as our normal development branch.\nIf an LTR is important to you, please consider also directly supporting the QGIS project, or encourage your commercial provider to use LTR as a basis for your enterprise solution so that everyone may benefit from a stable platform that is being continuously improved and refined. Note that for users and organizations that like to live on the frontier, our regular four-monthly releases will continue unabated.\nNew Features in QGIS 2.14 'Essen'\nIf you are upgrading from QGIS 2.8 (our previous LTR version) you will find a great many new features in this release. We encourage you to peruse the changelogs for the intermediate non LTR 2.10 and 2.12 releases as this QGIS 2.14 includes all features published in those releases too. Note that 2.14 first enters the regular package repositories and will not immediately replace 2.8 in the LTR package repositories. That will happen when 2.16 is released.\nWhenever new features are added to software they introduce the possibility of new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker.\nThanks\nWe would like to thank the developers, documenters, testers and all the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so). From the QGIS community we hope you enjoy this release!

In older QGIS versions, a \u0026quot;-1\u0026quot; value would mean no-match and other return values represented the character position - 1.\nProject files from earlier QGIS versions will need to be updated to reflect this change.\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer\nFeature: Zoom to feature with right-click in attribute table ¶ You can now zoom to any feature from within the attribute table (without having to select it first) by right-clicking and selecting zoom to feature.\nFeature: Speed and memory improvements ¶ Saving a set of selected features from a large layer is now much faster Updating only selected features using the field calculator is faster Faster zoom to selected on large layers Much faster get_feature expression function (especially when an indexed column in the referenced layer is used) SelectByAttribute and ExtractByAttribute processing algorithms are orders of magnitude faster, and can take advantage of database indices created on an attribute PointsInPolygon processing algorithm is many magnitudes faster Filtering the categories in a categorised renderer (eg, only showing some categories and unchecking others) is much faster, as now only the matching features are fetched from the data provider Significant reduction in the memory required for opening large vector layers Feature: More expression variables ¶ During rendering, new variables will be available:\n@geometry_part_count: The part count of the currently rendered geometry (interesting for multi-part features) @geometry_part_num: 1-based index of the currently rendered geometry part These are useful to apply different styles to different parts of multipart features:\n@map_extent_width: The width of the currently rendered map in map units @map_extent_height: The height of the currently rendered map in map units @map_extent_center: The center point of the currently rendered map in map units Variables relating to the operating system environment have also been added:\n@qgis_os_name: eg 'Linux','Windows' or 'OSX' @qgis_platform: eg 'Desktop' or 'Server' @user_account_name: current user's operating system account name @user_full_name: current user's name from operating system account (if available) This feature was funded by Andreas Neumann (the OS and user related variables)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson, Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Better control over placement of map elements ¶ QGIS 2.14 has gained finer control over the placement of north arrows, scale bars and copyright notices on the main map canvas. You can now precisely set the position of these elements using a variety of units (including millimeters, pixels and percent).\nFeature: Paid bugfixing programme ¶ Prior to each release, we hold a paid bugfixing programme where we fund developers to clean up as many bugs as possible. We have decided to start including a report back on the paid bugfixing programme as part of our changelog report. Note that this list is not exhaustive.\nSandro Santilli: Postgis Connection freeze if you press \u0026quot;Set filter\u0026quot; during loading of data Sandro Santilli: db_manager is unable to load rasters from connections with no dbname specified Sandro Santilli: Plugin layers do not work correctly with rotation Sandro Santilli: Crash in QgsGeomColumnTypeThread stopping connection scan #14140 #13806 Sandro Santilli: Crash after bulk change of attribute value in shapefile Sandro Santilli: KMZ causes QGIS application crash (Mac) Sandro Santilli: QGIS 2.8.1 crash opening FileGDB (openGDB-Driver) Sandro Santilli: QGIS crashes when removing vertex of a multipart geometry Sandro Santilli: test -V -R qgis_analyzertest segfaults Sandro Santilli: output/bin/qgis_diagramtest segfaults Sandro Santilli: Overflow on primary key with negative values; crashes QGIS when editing #13958 #14262 Sandro Santilli: PyQgsPostgresProvider test hangs in absence of test database Sandro Santilli: TestVectorLayerJoinBuffer hangs if database is not available Nyall Dawson: BLOCKER: Crash when opening layer properties dialog for geometryless vector layer Nyall Dawson: Broken server side filtering for OGR, Oracle and Spatialite layers Nyall Dawson: BLOCKER: Bad polygon digitizing in master Nyall Dawson: BLOCKER: Heatmap with expression triggers segfault Nyall Dawson: BLOCKER: unchecking one sub-layer of a categorized symbology leads to no features being drawn Nyall Dawson: HIGH: A Multiband image(e.g. landsat5,7,8) cannot be displayed in windows8 Nyall Dawson: BLOCKER: CurvePolygons not drawn Nyall Dawson: BLOCKER: \u0026quot;Merge Attributes\u0026quot; tool doesn't change values when they are typed Nyall Dawson: HIGH: Filter legend by content is broken when renderer contains duplicate symbols Nyall Dawson: Fix issues with conversion of renderers to rule based renderer resulting in broken renderer Nyall Dawson: Fix categorised renderer does not store changes to the source symbol Nyall Dawson: HIGH: Avoid crash with raster calculator and huge raster inputs Nyall Dawson: HIGH: @value variable of simple symbol fill color wrongly gets modified in data-defined expression Nyall Dawson: HIGH: Editing Composer legend while filtered does not work Nyall Dawson: NORMAL: Deleting nodes - inconsistent behaviour Nyall Dawson: Fix handling of time value in attributes Nyall Dawson: Dialog tab order fixes Nyall Dawson: BLOCKER: crash when adding multiple files from browser panel Nyall Dawson: HIGH: Merge selected features tool corrupts data when columns are defined as \u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot; Nyall Dawson: Correctly handle LongLong fields in merge attribute dialog Nyall Dawson: Fix misleading display of calculation details in measure tool dialog (was misleading and inaccurate for many CRS/unit combinations) Nyall Dawson: NORMAL: max value for option \u0026quot;increase size of small diagrams\u0026quot; not sufficient Nyall Dawson: BLOCKER: Area not calculated correctly with OTF on Nyall Dawson: NORMAL: Incoherent lat/lon coordinates in a projected coordinate system project Nyall Dawson: NORMAL: make the field calculator compute areas and lengths in units other than map units #12939 #2402 #4857 Nyall Dawson: NORMAL: different built-in tools calculate inconsistent polygon areas Nyall Dawson: NORMAL: In virtual fields $area function computes always values using \u0026quot;None/planimetric\u0026quot; ellipsoid Martin Dobias: raster layer drawn as garbage Martin Dobias: HIGH: Multi-threaded rendering and OTF reprojection issues #11441 #11746 Martin Dobias: BLOCKER: Regression in \u0026quot;save as\u0026quot; dialog for shapefiles Martin Dobias: Slow loading of attribute table in debug mode Martin Dobias: BLOCKER: Crash when changing renderer type Martin Dobias: HIGH: Custom python renderer issues #1 Martin Dobias: HIGH: Custom python renderer issues #2 Martin Dobias: 2.5d renderer fixes Martin Dobias: HIGH: Long freeze when initializing snapping Martin Dobias: NORMAL: Loading of data-defined from xml Martin Dobias: Fix DB manager to work with SpatiaLite \u0026lt; 4.2 Martin Dobias: NORMAL: Crash while rendering in debug mode Martin Dobias: BLOCKER: Fix selection / identification in spatialite views #14232 #14233 Martin Dobias: BLOCKER: Fix drag\u0026amp;drop of spatialite tables Jürgen Fischer:Zoom to layer works incorrectly while layer editing Jürgen Fischer:Help viewer process running in the background with no help viewer (or even QGIS) open Jürgen Fischer:Spatialindex include path missing in some components Jürgen Fischer:compile fails attempting to generate qgsversion.h Jürgen Fischer:Edit widget configuration is stored twice Jürgen Fischer:Extra space in \u0026quot;IS NOT\u0026quot; operator makes the expression return wrong selection Jürgen Fischer:QGIS greadily allocates memory and crashes when editing moderately large shapefiles with the node tool Jürgen Fischer:French reprojection use ntf_r93.gsb (IGNF:LAMBE etc ..)

This is a handy shortcut to do operations such as apply a buffer to a group of selected features, and together with all the newly added geometry functions in 2.14 makes for a very handy way to manipulate your geometries!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New expression functions in 2.14 ¶ Lots of new expression functions have been added for version 2.14:\nrelate: performs a DE-9IM geometry relation by either returning the DE-9IM representation of the relationship between two geometries, or by testing whether the DE-9IM relationship matches a specified pattern. the make_point function now accepts optional z and m values, and a new make_point_m function has been added for creation of PointM geometries. m and z functions for retrieving the m and z values from a point geometry new make_line and make_polygon functions, for creation of line and polygon geometries from a set of points reverse, for reversing linestrings eval function, which can evaluate a string as though it is an expression of its own translate function, for translating geometries by an x/y offset darker and lighter functions, which take a color argument and make it darker or lighter by a specified amount radians and degrees: for converting angles between radians and degrees point_on_surface: returns a point on the surface of a geometry exterior_ring: returns the exterior ring for a polygon geometry is_closed: returns true if a linestring is closed new geometry accessor functions: geometry_n (returns a specific geometry from within a collection), interior_ring_n (returns an interior ring from within a polygon) num_geometries: returns number of geometries inside a collection num_rings: returns number of rings in a polygon geometry object num_interior_rings: returns number of interior rings in a polygon nodes_to_points, for converting every node in a geometry to a multipoint geometry segments_to_lines, for converting every segment in a geometry to a multiline geometry closest_point: returns closest point in a geometry to a second geometry shortest_line: returns the shortest possible line joining two geometries nodes_to_points and segments_to_lines are intended for use with geometry generator symbology, eg to allow use of m and z values for nodes/lines with data defined symbology.\nOther improvements:\ngeometries and features can now be used in conditional functions. For instance, this allows expressions like case when $geometry then ... else ... and case when get_feature(...) then ... else ... Analysis tools ¶ Feature: More statistics available in merge attributes tool ¶ When using either the merge attribute values or merge features tool, there are additional summary statistics available which can be used to set the resultant attribute values. These include Q1, Q3, inter-quartile ranges, majority and minority values, and number of unique values, amongst others.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: z/m values are shown when using the identify tool ¶ The identify tool is now able to show any z or m value present in the identified features. If the feature is a line or polygon, the tool will show the vertex number and x/y/z/m for the nearest vertex to the identified point. The identify tool now also shows the number of parts and part number for collections.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Unified handling of distance and area units and coordinate formats ¶ In QGIS 2.14 the handling of various options regarding distance units, area units and coordinate display have been unified, simplified, and moved to Project Properties. This change brings numerous benefits, including:\nThe coordinate format specified in Project Properties is consistently used whenever a coordinate is displayed to the user, including the identify tool results and the status bar display. The setting for distance and area units in Project Properties is respected for all distance and area calculations, including the measure tool, identify results, and use of the $area, $length and $perimeter functions. Additional area units have been added, including square yards, acres, hectares and more. Additional angular units have been added to the angle measurement tool, including rotations, minutes of arc and seconds of arc. It's now possible to show the coordinates in latitude and longitude in the status bar even when using a projected CRS. This feature was funded by QGIS sponsored bug fixing program\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Browser Improvements ¶ The QGIS Browser is a filesystem, OGC Web Services and Database Connection panel that lets you easily drag and drop any layer from the aforementioned sources into your map canvas (or into the DB Manager window). Two useful new improvements were added for this release:\nPaths can be selectively hidden from the browser panel - this is useful to declutter your sources list and focus only on relevant directories. Load projects directly from the browser - now you can drag and drop a whole project into the QGIS map canvas and it will be loaded. This feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Cache WMS capabililies ¶ QGIS will now cache WMS GetCapabilities requests so that on subsequent use response times will be quicker when using that service. By default the cache period is 24 hours, but you can adjust this in the Network tab of the QGIS Settings dialog.\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer\nFeature: Curved geometry support expanded ¶ The delimited text provider now supports curved WKT strings, and the memory provider (eg \u0026quot;temporary scratch\u0026quot; layers) has gained full support for curved geometries. Additionally, if QGIS has been built using GDAL versions 2.0 and up then QGIS will fully support curved geometries in supported file types (eg GML files).\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Better handling of time and datetime fields ¶ QGIS 2.14 has improved handling of time and datetime field types, including:\nPostgreSQL timestamp fields are correctly handled The expression engine now has full support for time fields The expression builder now shows preview calculation results for date, time, date time and interval calculations Time fields are fully supported by vector file layers (depending on file format), PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server and temporary scratch layers Saving layers to vector files will preserve time fields if supported by vector layer format (eg MapInfo .tab files) This feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer, Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Z/M support in delimited text provider ¶ The delimited text provider has gained support for WKT strings containing Z and M coordinates. For example you can express a point with z and measure elements like this : POINT ZM (1 1 5 60).\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Transaction groups for postgres editing ¶ A new option has been introduced to enable transactional editing.\nWhen this option is enabled\nAll layers from the same database are put into a transaction group When the first layer of a group is put into edit mode, all others are also put into edit mode automatically When a layer is edited, the changes are sent to the database immediately, allowing triggers and constraints to be applied immediately When one layer in a transaction group is committed, all layers are committed (database transaction) When one layer in a transaction group is rolled back, all layers are rolled back (database transaction) This feature is currently Experimental. If you find any problems, please report them.\nThis is only implemented for postgres databases at the moment.\nThis feature was funded by SIGE\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn, OPENGIS.ch, based on work by Sourcepole\nFeature: Postgres provider PKI authentication ¶ The ability to use the QGIS Authentication Manager introduced in 2.12 has been extended to the PostGIS provider. This allows connecting to Postgres using basic or PKI authentication, with the credentials stored in the QGIS configuration. The new Postgres provider authentication can also be used in the DB manager.\nThis feature was funded by Boundless Spatial\nThis feature was developed by Luigi Pirelli\nFeature: Virtual layers ¶ Dynamic SQL queries can now be used on any kind of vector layers that QGIS is able to load, even if it the layer format itself has no support for SQL queries!\nA new kind of vector layer called \u0026quot;virtual layer\u0026quot; is now available for that purpose. These allow you to create a virtual layer by defining a query (including support for aggregates and joins) from other layers in your project. The resultant layer will be a live, dynamic view of the query result, so any changes to the source layers will be automatically and immediately reflected in the virtual layer!\nThe supported SQL dialect is SQLite with Spatialite functions. QGIS expression functions can also be used in queries. Any kind of vector layers can be accessed in the query, including multiple layers from different data providers to make joins.\nSupport for virtual layers has also been added to DB Manager as well as to the Processing toolbox where a new 'Execute SQL' tool is available.\nThis feature was funded by MEDDE (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)\nThis feature was developed by Hugo Mercier / Oslandia\nFeature: More file extensions for GDAL and OGR providers file selectors ¶ For vector and raster files, QGIS relies on the GDAL/OGR library. It means that nearly any file format that can be opened by GDAL or OGR can be directly opened in QGIS. Until now, some file extensions were not added in the GDAL or OGR file selector, resulting in users believing that QGIS could not open or handle those file formats. To minimise this problem, some new extensions have been added to GDAL and OGR file selector filters:\nFor vector files:\n.thf for EDIGEO French cadastre format .ods for OpenDocument Spreadsheet LibreOffice format .xls for Microsoft Excel format .xlsx for Microsoft Excel OpenXML format .xml for NAS - ALKIS format .map for WAsP format .pix for PCIDSK format .gtm and.gtz for GPSTrackMaker format .vfk for VFK format .osm and .pbf for OpenStreetMap format .sua for SUA format .txt for OpenAir format .xml for Planetary Data Systems TABLE format .htf for Hydrographic Transfer Format .svg for SVG format .gen for ARCGEN .sxf for Storage and eXchange Format .pdf for Geospatial PDF vector format .sgy and .segy for SEG-Y format .seg, .seg1, .sp1, .uko, .ukooa for SEGUKOOA format .ovf for VRT vector file format .kmz for compressed KML (KMZ) format .db3, .s3db, .sqlite3, .db3, .s3db, .sqlite3 for SQLite/Spatialite format .sl3 for SQLite Spatial (FDO) format CouchDB Spatial (via URL) For raster files:\n.ovr for vrt raster file format This feature was developed by Médéric Ribreux\nFeature: Use ST_RemoveRepeatedPoints for server-side simplification with PostGIS 2.2 (or newer) layers ¶ When using a PostGIS 2.2 instance, QGIS now uses the ST_RemoveRepeatedPoints function instead of the ST_SnapToGrid function to process server-side simplification, as described by Paul Ramsey.\nThis method will decrease the number of vertices of the geometries that QGIS needs to download from the server, which will increase rendering speed and save bandwith between QGIS and the PostgreSQL server.\nThis feature was developed by Michaël Douchin @kimaidou\nData management ¶ Feature: Removal of SPIT plugin ¶ The \u0026quot;SPIT\u0026quot; plugin is no longer bundled with QGIS, as the plugin was unmaintained and has been surpassed by DB Manager and the processing database import algorithms.\nThis feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: DXF export: option to use title instead of name as DXF layer name in application and server ¶ This feature was funded by City of Uster\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer\nFeature: Geometry type can be overridden in the vector save as dialog ¶ This makes it possible to do things like save a geometryless table WITH a geometry type, so that geometries can then be manually added to rows. Previously this was only possible to do in QGIS by resorting to dummy joins or other workarounds.\nAdditionally, options have been added for forcing the output file to be multi type, or include a z-dimension.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Vector joins are now saved within QLR layer-definition-files ¶ Feature: External Resource widget ¶ A new form widget is now available. It is named \u0026quot;External resource\u0026quot; and it allows a more complete handling of attributes assigned to file paths storing. Here is a complete summary of the widget features:\nYou can set an extension filter to force the storing of fixed file formats. If a filter is set, the file selector will only show file names that are relevant to the filter (it is still possible to select any file by using '*' character in the search field). Filter syntax is the same than Qt widget QFileDialog::getOpenFileName. You can set a default path. Each time a user triggers the widget, a file selector will open at the default path (if set). If no default path has been set, the file selector will use the last path selected from an \u0026quot;External resource\u0026quot; widget. If the widget has never been used, the file selector defaults to opening on the project path. You can define and set relative path storing. Relative path storing will allow you to save only the part of the path which is after the default path (if default path is set) or the current project path. This is particularly useful when you want to save long paths into limited size attributes (like text attributes for Shapefiles which are limited to 254 characters), or for creating self-contained project and data file archives for distribution. Another new feature to make the widget easier to use is that file paths can now be displayed as hyperlinks. Clicking the hyperlink will directly open the linked file from QGIS. You can configure this option to display the full path of the file or only its file name. The file will be opened using the default handler for that file format from your operating system. You can also use a URL instead of a file path. The widget will interpret it as a URL and you will be able to open the linked web page directly in your default web browser. You can choose to store directory paths instead of file paths. There is an integrated document viewer in this widget. You can use it to display pictures or webpages directly into QGIS. The file chooser for the integrated viewer will benefit from all the above mentioned options. For more information on configuration options, you can use the tool tips of the configuration dialog box.\nThe main aim of this new widget is to fix and improve the two existing 'File name' and 'Photo' widgets, and replace them with a single unified widget. For the moment, you can still use the old widgets but they will be deprecated and removed for QGIS 3.0. We recommend to switch your projects to use the new 'External Resource' widget now.\nThis feature was developed by:\nDenis Rouzaud Matthias Kuhn at OPENGIS.ch Médéric Ribreux Feature: N:M relation editing ¶ This adds the possibility to manage data on a normalised relational database in N:M (many to many) relations. On the relation editor in a form, the tools to add, delete, link and unlink also work on the linking table if a relation is visualized as a N:M relation.\nConfiguration is done through the fields tab where on the relation a second relation can be chosen (if there is a suitable relation in terms of a second relation on the linking table).\nLimitations:\nQGIS is not a database management system.\nIt is based on assumptions about the underlying database system. In particular:\nit expects an ON DELETE CASCADE or similar measure on the second relation it does not take care of setting the primary key when adding features. Either users need to be instructed to set them manually or - if it's a database derived value - the layers need to be in transaction mode This feature was funded by République et canton de Neuchâtel, Ville de Pully, Ville de Vevey\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Configurable rubber band color ¶ You can now set the rubber band width and color used for digitising.\nFeature: Trace digitising tool ¶ The new trace digitising tool is an advanced digitising tool that allows you to digitise features in one layer by tracing features in another layer.\nThe trace tool:\nuses Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s shortest path algorithm to find traceable routes can trace routes over multiple distinct features can be used with Advanced Digitising tools (e.g. reshaping) can be enabled and disabled by pressing T on your keyboard while digitising is fast and easy to use You can read more about this feature here and with this tutorial.\nThis feature was funded by: The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council, Ujaval Gandhi, Surrey Heath Borough Council, Matias Arnold, Northumberland National Park Authority, Buccleuch Estates Limited, Countryscape\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting\nLabelling ¶ Feature: \u0026quot;Cartographic\u0026quot; placement mode for point labels ¶ In this placement mode, point label candidates are generated following ideal cartographic placement rules, eg label placements are prioritised in the order:\ntop right top left bottom right bottom left middle right middle left top, slightly right bottom, slightly left (respecting the guidelines from Krygier and Wood (2011) and other cartographic master works)\nPlacement priority can also be set for an individual feature using a data defined list of prioritised positions. This also allows for only certain placements to be used, so eg for coastal features you could prevent labels being placed over the land.\nThis feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Applying label distance from symbol bounds ¶ When this setting is active, the label distance applies from the bounds of the rendered symbol for a point instead of the point itself. It is especially useful when the symbol size is not fixed, eg if it is set by a data defined size or when using different symbols in a categorised renderer.\nNote that this setting is only available with the new Cartographic point label placement mode.\nThis feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Control over label rendering order ¶ A new control for setting a label's \u0026quot;z-index\u0026quot; has been added to the labeling properties dialog. This control (which also accepts data-defined overrides for individual features) determines the order in which labels are rendered. Label layers with a higher z-index are rendered on top of labels from a layer with a lower z-index.\nAdditionally, the logic has been tweaked so that if 2 labels have matching z-indexes, then:\nif they are from the same layer, a smaller label will always be drawn above a larger label if they are from different layers, the labels will be drawn in the same order as the layers themselves (ie respecting the order set in the legend) Diagrams can also have their z-index set (but not data defined) so that the order of labels and diagrams can be controlled.\nNote that this does NOT allow labels to be drawn below the features from other layers, it just controls the order in which labels are drawn on top of your map.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Actual rendered symbol is now considered as an obstacle for point feature labels ¶ Previously, only the point feature itself was treated as an obstacle for label candidates. If a large or offset symbol was used for the point, then labels were allowed to overlap this symbol without incurring the obstacle cost.\nNow, the actual size and offset of the rendered symbol are considered when detecting whether a label collides with a point feature. The result is that QGIS now avoids drawing labels over point symbols in more circumstances.\nThis feature was funded by City of Uster\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: Paste a style to multiple selected layers or to all layers in a legend group ¶ This feature adds the possibility to paste the style of one layer to a layer group or selected layers.\nThis feature was developed by Salvatore Larosa\nFeature: Filter legend by expression ¶ It is now possible to filter elements of the legend by an expression. It has been designed with the filtering of rule-based or categorized symbology in mind.\nThe legend filtering is available in the legend of the main application as well as for legend components of the QGIS composer.\nThis feature was funded by Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne (Adour-Garonne Water Agency)\nThis feature was developed by Hugo Mercier / Oslandia\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: New options for filtering legend elements ¶ This introduces two new options to filter legend elements.\nThe first, filter by expression, allows users to set an expression for filtering which features should be shown in the legend. Only symbols with a matching feature will be shown in the legend.\nThe second filter option allows a composer legend to be filtered to include only items which are contained within the current atlas polygon.\nThis feature was developed by Hugo Mercier (Oslandia)\nFeature: Additional paths for composer templates ¶ You can now define custom paths that should be used for QGIS to find composer templates. This means that you can for example put a bunch of templates in a network share and give your users access to that folder in addition to the local ones that exist on their own system. To manage the composer template search paths, look in Settings -\u0026gt; Options -\u0026gt; Composer\nThis feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: Multiple selection of compositions in manager ¶ The Composer Manager has gained support for managing multiple compositions at the same time. You can now open or delete multiple compositions at once by using the Ctrl key and selecting multiple compositions from the list.\nThis feature was developed by Médéric Ribreux\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Authentication system support for plugin manager ¶ Support for the new authentication system has been added to the plugin manager. This allows users to apply authentication configurations for connections to plugin repositories, and system administrators to create authenticated access to plugin repositories and/or the download packages of plugins.\nThis feature was funded by Boundless Spatial\nThis feature was developed by Larry Shaffer\nProcessing ¶ Feature: New algorithms in 2.14 ¶ QGIS geoalgorithms: ¶ Smooth: for smoothing line or polygon layers. Reverse line direction. GDAL/OGR geoalgorithms: ¶ gdal2tiles: builds a directory with TMS tiles, KMLs and simple web viewers. gdal_retile: retiles a set of tiles and/or build tiled pyramid levels. Feature: Unit Tests Q/A ¶ To guarantee the long-term stability of the processing module, a new testing framework has been introduced.\nProcessing geo-algorithms are executed after every change which hits the QGIS source code and the result is compared to a control dataset to guarantee correct behavior. This gives an immediate feedback about possible regressions.\nIt is possible - and desired - that more tests are added. You can read more about how to participate.\nThis feature was funded by The QGIS Project\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn, OPENGIS.ch\nFeature: Improved toolbox ¶ The simplified interface has been removed, and a new and more user-friendly system of managing providers has been added. The algorithm search functionality now also searches in providers that are not active, and suggests activating them.\nThis feature was funded by Boundless Spatial\nThis feature was developed by Víctor Olaya\nFeature: Batch processes can be saved and later recovered from the batch processing interface ¶ Feature: More informative algorithm dialog ¶ A short description is now shown along with the algorithm parameters, making it easy to understand the purpose of the algorithm.\nAlso, batch processes can be now started from the algorithm dialog, using the \u0026ldquo;Run as batch process\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; button\nFeature: GRASS7 v.net modules ¶ QGIS 2.14 Processing now incorporates v.net GRASS modules (only for GRASS7). Those modules are a set of algorithms that perform on graph line vector layers (networks). A graph is a set of vertices (or nodes or points) linked together with a set of edges (or arcs or lines). The set of edges is often called a network.\nThanks to v.net modules, you can easily calculate the shortest path between a set of nodes on the network or even compute the isochrone map from a set of central points. you can also easily solve the complex travelling salesman problem from a network and a set of travel nodes.\nv.net algorithms often use a line vector layer (for the network) and a point layer which represents the nodes you want to use for the computation. Be sure to use a true graph line vector layer for the network layer (edges need to be connected on vertex without intersection between edges) to avoid problems. You can also use any network layer attribute for cost calculation (the content of the attribute is used to calculate the travel cost of the edge).\nHere is a quick summary of the different algorithms that have been included into Processing:\nv.net.alloc: Allocates subnets from nearest centres. v.net.allpairs: Computes the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the network. v.net.arcs: Creates arcs from a file of points. v.net.articulation: Computes the articulation points in the network. v.net.bridge: Computes bridges of the network. v.net.centrality: Computes degree, centrality, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector centrality of each node of the network. v.net.components: Computes strongly and weakly connected components in the network. v.net.connect: Connects points (nodes) to nearest arcs in the network (and adds edges if necessary). v.net.connectivity: Computes vertex connectivity between two sets of nodes in the network. v.net.distance: Computes the shortest path via the network between two sets of nodes. v.net.flow: Computes the maximum flow between two sets of nodes in the network. v.net.iso: Computes the isochrone map of the network from a set of nodes. v.net.nodes: Extracts nodes of a network/graph layer. v.net.nreports: Reports information about the nodes. v.net.path: Finds the shortest path on the network between two nodes. v.net.report: Reports information about the edges of the network. v.net.salesman: Computes the travelling salesman path from a set of nodes on the network. v.net.spanningtree: Computes the Spanning tree of the network. v.net.steiner: Creates a Steiner tree for the network and given nodes. v.net.visibility: Performs visibility graph construction. Use the \u0026quot;Help\u0026quot; tab on each of the v.net Processing algorithm to read the official GRASS7 documentation directly for more information.\nThis feature was developed by Médéric Ribreux\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Redesign expression function editor ¶ With auto save\nFeature: Store python init code into the project ¶ Adds an option and code editor to store python form init code into the project (and the DB, since it's in the style section)\nFeature: New filtering and sorting options for QgsFeatureRequest ¶ QgsFeatureRequest now supports setting a maximum limit for the number of features returned. In many cases this limit is passed to the provider, resulting in significant performance gains when only a set number of features are required.\nAdditionally, QgsFeatureRequest now supports setting ordering for returned features. Again, in many cases this ordering is delegated to the provider so that it is performed \u0026quot;server side\u0026quot; for optimal performance.\nFeature: Custom feature form Python code options ¶ This feature adds more options to the custom feature form Python code:\nload from file (with file picker widget) load from the environment (i.e. a plugin or a Python init function) directly enter the code in an input widget (new option) The configuration options, including the custom Python code entered in the dialog are stored in the project as well as in the style QML settings and can be exported/restored from a DB.\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti (ItOpen)\nFeature: New PyQGIS classes in 2.14 ¶ New core classes ¶ QgsAttributeEditorElement\nabstract base class for any elements of a drag and drop form QgsAttributeEditorContainer\n- container for attribute editors, used to group them visually in an attribute form\nQgsAttributeEditorField\nelement for loading a field's widget onto a form QgsAttributeEditorRelation\nelement for loading a relation editor widget onto a form QgsEditFormConfig\nstores and sets configuration parameters for attribute editor forms QgsFeatureFilterProvider\n- provides an interface for modifying a QgsFeatureRequest in place to apply additional filters to the request\nQgsTracer - provides graph creation and shortest path search for vector layers\nQgsTransactionGroup\ninterface for grouping layers into single edit transactions QgsUnitTypes -helper functions for various unit types and conversions between units (eg distance and area units)\nQgsVirtualLayerDefinition\nclass for manipulating the definitions of virtual layers QgsVirtualLayerDefinitionUtils\nhelper utilities for working with QgsVirtualLayerDefinition objects Qgs25DRenderer -2.5D symbol renderer\nQgsGeometryGeneratorSymbolLayerV2\ngeometry generator symbol layer QgsFeatureRequest.OrderByClause\nclass for specifying a field sort order for feature requests QgsFeatureRequest.OrderBy\na prioritized list of order by clauses for sorting New GUI classes ¶ Reusable widgets: ¶ QgsExternalResourceWidget\n- widget for displaying a file path with a push button for an \u0026quot;open file\u0026quot; dialog, and optional display of pictures or HTML files\nQgsFileWidget -widget for selecting a file or a folder\nQgsLegendFilterButton\n- tool button widget that allows enabling or disabling legend filter by contents of the map\nQgsMapCanvasTracer\n- an extension of QgsTracer that provides extra functionality for interacting with map canvases\nQgs25DRendererWidget\nwidget for setting properties for a 2.5D renderer QgsColorWidgetAction\nwidget action for embedding a color picker inside a menu Reusable dialogs: ¶ QgsStyleV2GroupSelectionDialog dialog for grouping selections in a style QgsGroupWMSDataDialog dialog for setting properties for a WMS group QgsOrderByDialog dialog for specifying sort ordering of fields QGIS Server ¶ Feature: STARTINDEX param in WFS GetFeature Request ¶ `STARTINDEX is standard in WFS 2.0, but it's an extension for WFS 1.0 implemented in QGIS Server.\nSTARTINDEX can be used to skip some features in the result set and in combination with MAXFEATURES provides for the ability to use WFS GetFeature to page through results. Note that STARTINDEX=0 means start with the first feature, skipping none.\nThis feature was developed by 3Liz\nFeature: showFeatureCount in GetLegendGraphic ¶ Add non-standard parameter showFeatureCount to add feature count in the legend. To activate it,showFeatureCount can be set to TRUE or 1.\nThis feature needs a fake X server.\nThis feature was developed by 3Liz\nFeature: Option to avoid rendering artefacts at edges of tiles ¶ Feature: Configuration checker in project properties ¶ To assist with configuring a project for QGIS Server, a new configuration checker has been added to project properties.\nThe checker tests for errors like:\nduplicate names or short names used as OWS names invalid OWS names missing vector layer encodings This feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by 3Liz\nFeature: WMS INSPIRE Capabilities ¶ In the project properties the user can:\nactivate INSPIRE capabilities select the language for the service, from 24 EU official languages + 5 regional languages choose the scenario for service metadata and specify their parameters The WMS 1.3.0 capabilities reflects the INSPIRE configuration.\nThis feature was developed by 3Liz\nFeature: Add short name to layers, groups and project ¶ A number of elements have both a Name and a Title. The Name is a text string used for machine-to-machine communication while the Title is for the benefit of humans. For example, a dataset might have the descriptive Title Maximum Atmospheric Temperature and be requested using the abbreviated Name ATMAX.\nUsers can already set a title for layers and project. OpenGeospatial Web Services, OWS (WMS, WFS, WCS), name is based on the name used in the layer tree. This name is more a label for humans than a name for machine-to-machine communication.\nTo add the capability for users to define Name as a text string for machine-to-machine communication, this feature adds:\nshort name line edits to layer properties WMS data dialog to layer tree group (short name, title, abstract) short name line edits to project properties add a regexp validator \u0026quot;^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9._-]*\u0026quot; to short name line edit accessible through a static method add a TreeName element in the fullProjectSettings If a short name has been set for layers, groups and project it is used by QGIS Sever as the layer name.\nThis feature was developed by 3Liz\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Size assistant for varying line width ¶ Feature: Support for transparency in SVG color parameters ¶ Non-bundled SVGs must add:\nfill-opacity=\u0026quot;param(fill-opacity)\u0026quot;\nand\nstroke-opacity=\u0026quot;param(outline-opacity)\u0026quot;\nto enable transparency support.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Easy duplication of symbol layers ¶ A new \u0026quot;duplicate\u0026quot; button has been added to the symbol properties dialog, which allows symbol layers to be easily duplicated.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: 2.5D Renderer ¶ This adds a configuration interface and renderer that makes it easy to put all the pieces together which are required to get a 2.5D effect.\nIt allows for configuring some of the styling and is meant to create an easy-to-use setup.\nSince every part of the system is built around QGIS' internal rendering and symbology engine, there is much to fine tune. To get all the possibilities, just change the renderer to a graduated, categorized or single symbol renderer upon creation and you will find full access to improve the style to your needs.\nThis feature was developed by:\nMatthias Kuhn at OPENGIS.ch This feature was funded by:\nRegional Council of Picardy ADUGA Ville de Nyon Wetu GIT cc Feature: Allow definition of rendering order for features ¶ When features are required to be rendered in a particular order, this can be specified by using an arbitrary expression.\nThis can be configured in the layer's symbology configuration dialog and can be a simple field or a complex expression.\nIt also provides control over ascending or descending order as well as whether NULLs are first or last.\nIf possible, the request will be sent to the database (this depends on the complexity of the expression as well as the provider for the layer). If it is not possible to send the request to the database, the ordering will be performed on the local machine.\nThis is used by the 2.5D renderer to render features based on their distance from the \u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;.\nThis is also available for plugins:\nlayer.getFeatures( QgsFeatureRequest().setOrderBy( 'name' ) ) -- alphabetical by name This feature was developed by: Matthias Kuhn at OPENGIS.ch This feature was funded by: Regional Council of Picardy, ADUGA, Ville de Nyon, Wetu GIT cc\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn, OPENGIS.ch\nFeature: Geometry generator symbols ¶ Geometry generator symbols allow using the expression engine to modify the geometry before rendering or even creating new geometries while rendering based on feature attributes.\nThis can use all kinds of spatial operators like buffer, translate, intersect or extrude with parameters based on attributes only for the rendering without actually modifying the data in the source.\nExamples ¶ Translate a geometry ¶ Used for the roof of the 2.5D renderer\ntranslate( $geometry, 10, 10 ) Fill style for polygon border ¶ This generates a polygon which represents the outline of the original polygon (Example image)\ndifference( buffer( $geometry , 250 ), buffer( $geometry, -250 ) ) Different symbol layers can contain different geometry generators, this allows displaying different versions of a geometry at the same time. The 2.5D renderer serves as an example.\nThis feature was funded by Regional Council of Picardy, ADUGA, Ville de Nyon, Wetu GIT cc\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn, OPENGIS.ch\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Attribute table can be refreshed ¶ An option to reload attributes within the attribute table is now available.\nFeature: Directly set renderer and class symbol colors from context menu in legend ¶ Shows a color wheel widget in the menu, which allows you to edit the color for a symbol interactively without even having to even open a single dialog!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Edit legend symbols directly from layer tree ¶ This adds a new \u0026quot;edit symbol\u0026quot; item to the right-click menu for a renderer child legend item (eg categories for the categorised renderer). Selecting it opens a symbol editor dialog which allows for directly editing the class's symbol. It's much faster than opening the layer properties and going through the style tab. You can also double-click on a child item to open the symbol editor immediately.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Show/hide all legend items via the context menu ¶ Allows toggling on/off all the symbol items for categorized/graduated/rule-based layers via the right click menu on an item. Previously you'd have to toggle each item manually one-by-one.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog214/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 2.14"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 2.16 ¶ Release date: 2016-07-08\nThis is the log for the next release of QGIS - version 2.16.0 'Nødebo'.

When set to \u0026quot;GeoJSON\u0026quot;, copying features in QGIS will place a GeoJSON text representation of the features on the clipboard for easy pasting into other applications/JavaScript code. These settings can be found in the Settings -\u0026gt; Options -\u0026gt; Data Sources -\u0026gt; Copy features as.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Store spatial bookmarks in project files ¶ If you are creating a spatial bookmark, you can now choose to store the bookmark in your active project file. Scroll across in the bookmarks panel to find the checkbox that enables this capability.\nThis feature was developed by Stéphane Brunner\nFeature: Support for GNSS GNRMC messages ¶ QGIS can now handle GLONASS satellite data ($GN* lines) to get a more precise Position from external GPS/GNSS Receivers.\nThis feature was developed by Ondřej Fibich\nFeature: Paste GeoJSON features directly into QGIS ¶ QGIS clipboard handler can now parse many additional text formats, including native support for GeoJSON feature collections. This allows you to directly copy and paste GeoJSON strings into QGIS and have them automatically converted into QGIS features and geometries.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Map tip improvements ¶ Maptip visibility is now preserved across sessions Maptips can now show HTML content, including images, videos and URL links This feature was funded by OPENGIS.ch GmbH\nThis feature was developed by Marco Bernasocchi (OpenGIS.ch)\nFeature: Desktop MIME icons for QGIS file types ¶ It's now easier to recognise and differentiate QGIS's file types on your operating system files manager. There are now desktop MIME Icons for the following file types:\n*.qgs - QGIS Project file *.qml - Layer settings file *.qlr - Layer definitions file *.qpt - Composer template file This feature was developed by Alexandre Neto\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Map canvas magnifier ¶ A magnifier tool has been added to QGIS, which allows you to magnify the map at a given scale. This allows you to zoom in to a map without altering the map scale, making it easier to accurately tweak the positions of labels and symbols. Additionally, a default magnification value can be defined in settings, which is very useful for high resolution screens!\nThis feature was funded by the QWAT project\nThis feature was developed by Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)\nFeature: Improvements to map zooming ¶ QGIS 2.16 brings improvements to the way you can zoom in and out of the map canvas.\nHolding down Ctrl while using the mouse wheel to zoom in or out now results in a finer zoom. This behavior brings canvas into line with composer. Pressing Ctrl++ or Ctrl+- performs an immediate zoom in/out on the map canvas When certain map tools are active, you can perform a web-map style zoom by holding down Shift and dragging a rectangle on the map to zoom to that area. This is enabled for the map tools which are not selection tools (since they use shift for adding to selection), and edit tools. This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Redesigned interactive gradient editor ¶ The gradient ramp editor has been reworked with interactive controls for easier manipulation of gradients. The dialog now also includes an interactive plot for modifying gradient stops via the color HSV or RGB values. The new editor features:\ndrag to move color stops double clicking to add a new stop pressing delete will remove the selected stop pressing arrow keys will move the selected stop, and holding shift while pressing a cursor key results in a larger move drag and drop a color onto the widget to add a new stop This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Choice of default view for the attribute dialog ¶ In previous QGIS versions the attribute dialog would always be opened in the table view. Now, you have the choice of always defaulting the dialog to either the table view, form view or to remember the last view used.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improvements to calendar popups ¶ Today's date is now highlighted in calendar popup widgets, making it easier to select a date relative to the current day.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved color pickers ¶ The color button dropdown menus now show a color wheel, allowing for very rapid adustments to colors.\nThis feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: Copy cell contents from attribute table ¶ A new context menu item called Copy cell content is now available in the menu opened by a right click on a cell within the attribute table. When this button is clicked, the content of the cell is copied in the clipboard, whatever the kind of widget.\nThis feature was developed by Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)\nFeature: Improved HiDPI support ¶ HiDPI screen users will notice an improved user interface as more work has been done to upgrade icons to rely on SVG images. As of QGIS 2.16, all toolbars are now HiDPI-compatible.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Improved map select tool behaviour ¶ The behavior of the map based selection tools has been refined, with the following changes:\nFor click-and-drag selections:\nholding Shift = add to selection holding Ctrl = subtract from selection holding Ctrl+Shift = intersect with current selection holding Alt (can be used with Shift/Ctrl too) = change from \u0026quot;intersects\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;fully contains\u0026quot; selection mode For single-click selections:\nholding Shift or Ctrl = toggle whether feature is selected (i.e. either add to current selection or remove from current selection) This change brings the canvas behavior into line with other design apps and also with the composer behavior.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nDocumentation Updates ¶ Feature: QGIS 2.14 Documentation ¶ Having now an automatic way to create a ticket in the documentation repository for each new feature in QGIS, we are sure that all new features is now in the documentation.\nThe documentation team worked hard on three releases of QGIS: 2.10, 2.12 and 2.14 so the documentation is now up to date for the current Long Term Release of QGIS. This is around 180 new features that have been documented in 4 months.\nIf you think there are some missing features in the documentation, feel free to add a new ticket, write small text to describe it or better push a contribution.\nThe documentation team has also worked on improving the documentation guidelines in order to ease contribution's process for new doc writers and help translators.\nThe documentation team will now work hard the next months to document the current stable release (2.16) of QGIS.\nCheck the 2.10, 2.12 and 2.14 milestone to see all the documentation work that has taken place:\nhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/milestone/5 https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/milestone/4 https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/milestone/3 Feature: Authentication system's documentation in users manual ¶ The authentication system features introduced in earlier versions of QGIS (2.12 and 2.14) are now fully documented in the Users manual, and will be a great contribute to the system's understanding and adoption.\nThis feature was funded by Boundless\nThis feature was developed by Larry Shaffer\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Arrow symbol layer ¶ The \u0026quot;arrow\u0026quot; symbol layer is a symbol layer allowing to draw straight or curved arrows from a line layer.\nIn curved mode, nodes of the line layer this symbol layer is applied to are used as control points for circle arcs. Arrows can be filled with whatever existing filling style QGIS supports. Options also allows to select the type of the arrow (with one or two heads, plain or halved), its width (that may be variable) and size of the heads.\nThis feature was funded by MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development) and Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Hugo Mercier\nFeature: New \u0026quot;Filled marker\u0026quot; symbol layer type ¶ A \u0026quot;filled marker\u0026quot; is similar to the simple marker symbol layer, except that it uses a fill sub symbol to render the marker. This allows use of all the existing QGIS fill (and outline) styles for rendering markers, eg gradient or shapeburst fills.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New accessibility and low vision symbols ¶ Additional accessibility and low visions symbols are now available in QGIS' SVG symbols collection.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: New simple marker symbols ¶ semicircle, third, quarter circles half triangle markers filled cross and hexagon markers diamond ellipse marker This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: \u0026quot;No symbol\u0026quot; renderer ¶ Using the new \u0026quot;No symbol\u0026quot; renderer in QGIS 2.16 no symbol will be drawn for features, but labeling, diagrams and other non-symbol parts will still be shown.\nSelections can still be made on the layer in the canvas and selected features will be rendered with a default symbol. Features being edited will also be shown.\nThis is intended as a handy shortcut for layers which you only want to show labels or diagrams for, and avoids the need to render symbols with totally transparent fill/border to achieve this. It may not sound useful from the title - but it's quite a handy shortcut!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: More control over centroid fill point rendering ¶ An option has been added to control whether the marker is drawn on all parts or a single part of multi-features.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Outline setting for font markers symbol ¶ Font markers symbol can now have outline, which can help increasing visibility of such symbols by adding an outline buffer color. Emoji-enabled font characters can serve as nice markers when used with a thick outline.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Control outline join style for simple, ellipse, and font markers ¶ Users can now change the join style of outlines for simple, ellipse, and font markers to fine-tune their symbology.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: New map tool for interactively setting point symbol offset ¶ Allows for setting a point's offset if it is bound to a field using data defined overrides. The offset field should be a text field. The map tool to interactively set the offset is in the Advanced digitizing toolbar in the icon group with the Rotate Point Symbols tool. See the attached animation for an example. Note that when making subsequent adjustments to the offset, you should drag from the original point vertex marker, not the current position of the symbol as rendered on the map.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Style Dock ¶ The style dock is a new, far more efficient, way to manage layer styles in QGIS. It supports a live preview of style changes as they are made, full undo / redo support and a less distracted workflow as you prepare your map cartography. For a comprehensive overview of the style dock's features, please see style dock part 1 and style dock part 2.\nThis feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Labeling map tools now work with rule-based labeling ¶ In previous versions of QGIS when rule-based labeling was in place, you could not use the labeling map tools to interactively place and rotate label positions. This is now supported.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias\nDiagrams ¶ Feature: Legend entries for diagram size ¶ A new \u0026quot;legend\u0026quot; tab has been added to diagram properties, allowing both the existing attribute legend and a new size legend to be enabled/disabled. The size legend has a configurable marker symbol.\nThis feature was funded by ADUGA\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Unit selection for outline width ¶ Outline width unit selection is now available. This allows for a map unit sized diagram that will grow and shrink based on map scale while maintaining a fixed millimeter outline width.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Diagrams behave like labels and can be managed from toolbar ¶ Originally, there was a toolbar for labels allowing to:\nset labeling options for labels of the current layer highlight the pinned labels. Highlighting is green on editable layer, blue otherwise. pin or unpin labels move, show and hide labels With this new feature, a new tool is available in the label toolbar allowing to set properties of diagrams for the current layer. Moreover, each tool mentioned above are now fully usable with diagrams too.\nThis feature was funded by MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)\nThis feature was developed by Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)\nRendering ¶ Feature: New options for on the fly simplification ¶ The user can select the algorithm to use when the local-side simplification runs to draw geometries faster. Now, QGIS provides three algorithms:\nDistance (default algorithm, and the only option available in previous QGIS releases) SnapToGrid Visvalingam This change also moves the local \u0026quot;on-the-fly\u0026quot; simplification from the provider and iterator classes to the rendering code. This avoids cases where simplification changes the geometry fetched from vector data providers, possibly affecting rule based and other expression based symbology. This is important when you have expressions that use the feature geometry (e.g. calculation of area) - we want to be sure that these calculations are done on the original geometry, not on the simplified ones.\nThis feature was developed by Alvaro Huarte\nFeature: Quantile based classification for raster layers ¶ This option can be found for single band pseudocolor rasters in the classification mode dialog.\nThis feature was developed by Piers Titus van der Torren\nFeature: Live hillshade renderer ¶ QGIS 2.16 has a new raster renderer that will dynamically create a hillshade model from a Digital Elevation Model.\nThis feature was developed by Asger Skovbo Petersen and Nathan Woodrow\nDigitizing ¶ Feature: \u0026quot;Repeating\u0026quot; locking mode for constraints ¶ When enabled, repeating locks are not automatically cleared when a new point is added. They are handy when the same constraint must be repeated for multiple points (eg adding vertices which are always 50 meters apart). This functionality is available in the Advanced Digitizing Panel.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Extend linestring geometries with reshape tool ¶ The reshape tool now allows you to extend linestrings, by starting a reshape at either a line's start or end point.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias\nFeature: Segmentation tolerance ¶ Support was added to set the segmentation tolerance (maximum angle or maximum difference). This setting controls the way circular arcs are rendered. The smaller maximum angle (in degrees) or maximum difference (in map units), the more straight line segments will be used during rendering. You can find this option in Settings -\u0026gt; Options -\u0026gt; Rendering -\u0026gt; Curve Segmentation.\nThis feature was developed by Marco Hugentobler\nData Management ¶ Feature: New configuration options for attribute table ¶ Allow reordering the attribute table columns (via right click on field name header --\u0026gt; \u0026quot;Organize Columns\u0026quot; dialog; drag and drop to reorder) Allow adding a new column to the attribute table to hold buttons for triggering an action based on the chosen feature Columns can be hidden from the attribute table (via right click on field name header) QGIS now remembers the width of any resized columns This feature was funded by Canton of Zug, Switzerland and MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)\nThis feature was developed by Stéphane Brunner (Camptocamp) and Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Multiple columns in attribute forms ¶ When using the drag and drop designer, a user can specify over how many columns the fields should be distributed.\nTo enable multiple columns in the \u0026quot;Fields\u0026quot; tab of the layer properties:\nMake sure you are using the drag and drop designer form mode Double click group containers, such as tabs or groups a small dialog will appear where you can select the nr of columns The order will be first column, second column, nth column, next row, etc.\nThis feature was funded by Canton of Zug, Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Control over attributes to export when saving a vector layer ¶ Checkboxes have been added so that you can select which attributes you want included in the export, and you also now have the option to write \u0026quot;displayed\u0026quot; values rather than raw values. This option is useful for layers with relations, where you'd like a literal value included rather than a numeric identifier.\nDepending on the data format, the \u0026quot;displayed value\u0026quot; is enabled by default, e.g. for export to spreadsheet formats (ODF, XLSX, CSV/Text).\nThis feature was partially funded by Canton of Zug, Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer, Even Rouault\nFeature: Forms view: side column now sortable ¶ In the forms mode of the QGIS attribute table there is a side column one can use to directly jump to a specific feature. Up-to this release, this side view was not sortable. For sorting, one had to jump to the table mode and then back to the form mode. Now one can directly sort the feature by the feature attribute preview in the side panel by chosing the sort function on the expression drop-down button above the side column.\nThis feature was funded by Canton of Zug, Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OpenGIS)\nFeature: Relation reference widget: shortcut for adding new values ¶ The relation reference widget was enhanced to allow quicker extensions of related value lists. If the checkbox \u0026quot;Allow adding new features\u0026quot; is enabled in the widget properties (access through \u0026quot;Fields\u0026quot; tab in layer properties), a green plus button will appear to the right of the widget. After pressing the \u0026quot;Plus\u0026quot; button, the dialog of the related table will open in \u0026quot;new record\u0026quot; mode where one can add an additional entry.\nThis feature was funded by Canton of Zug, Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OpenGIS)\nFeature: DXF export improvements ¶ Support has been added for rule based labeling and rotated symbols, and for outputting 3D geometries.\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer\nFeature: Top level widgets in drag and drop designer ¶ It is now possible to put widgets directly on the form with the drag and drop designer. A drag and drop designer form can therefore exist without any tabs on it.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Form based select and filter ¶ In QGIS 2.16 a new mode was added to the attribute table dialog for searching and filtering features. When activated (using a button on the toolbar or by pressing CTRL+F), the dialog will switch to form view and all widgets are replaced with their search widget wrapper variant.\nAlongside each widget is a tool button with options for controlling the search/filter behaviour for that field, eg \u0026quot;equal to\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;not equal to\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;is null\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;greater than\u0026quot;, etc.., with the options presented matching themselves to the corresponding field and widget type.\nNew buttons appear at the bottom of the form for either selecting matching features (with options for add to selection/remove from selection/select within current selection) or filtering features in the table (with options for adding features to a current filter or further restricting a current filter).\nYou can also access this mode with the new \u0026quot;Select by Value\u0026quot; option, or by pressing F3 with a layer selected.\nThis feature was funded by SIGE, City of Uster, Morges\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Create GeoPackage layers ¶ The GeoPackage format is an open standard for geospatial data that should be on your radar as a replacement for the ESRI Shapefile format. It addresses many shortcomings with the shape file format including limitations in the number and width of fields. In QGIS 2.16 it is now easy to create a new GeoPackage as it has been integrated into the Layer toolbar and Layer -\u0026gt; Create Layer menu.\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nFeature: Constraints on widgets ¶ In previous QGIS versions there was no way to check the validity of values entered by a user for a feature's attributes. Now, a user can specify a constraint on each widget in a layer's attribute form. Constraints are created using QGIS' expressions, eg \u0026quot;min_population\u0026quot; \u0026gt; 50000. A \u0026quot;Not Null\u0026quot; checkbox is also available to indicate that a value must be entered for the field. Additionally, descriptive text can be added to give the user helpful feedback when a constraint fails.\nConstraints are evaluated on the fly while a user is modifying a feature. A tooltip is available on any field having a constraint, showing the constraint's expression, the result of the evaluation and a description of the constraint. A message bar will also displayed at the top of the form summarizing any fields which do not meet the constraint criteria.\nThis feature was funded by the QWAT project and the Canton of Zug, Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch) and Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)\nFeature: Edit attributes of multiple features simultaneously ¶ This change allows the attributes of multiple features to be edited simultaneously. It is enabled when the attribute table dialog is in \u0026quot;form mode\u0026quot;, via a new \u0026quot;multi edit\u0026quot; button on the toolbar. There's also a shortcut to edit multiple selected features by using Edit -\u0026gt; Modify Attributes of Selected Features.\nIn this mode, attribute value changes will apply to all selected features. New widgets appear next to each editor widget allowing for display of the current multi-edit state and for rolling back changes on a field-by-field basis.\nChanges are made as a single edit command, so pressing undo will rollback the attribute changes for all selected features at once.\nMultiedit mode is only available for auto generated and drag and drop forms -it is not supported by custom ui forms.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Basel Stadt\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: New option to zoom to a layer's visible scale range ¶ For layers with a visible scale range set, selecting this option will automatically set the scale to the closest scale where the layer is visible. Additionally, the interface has been tweaked so that layers which are outside their scale range and hidden are shown greyed out in the layer tree.\nThis feature was funded by MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)\nThis feature was developed by Patrick Valsecchi (Camptocamp)\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: New tools for drawing polygons and polylines ¶ Two new types of composer shape items, based on nodes, are now available in the map composer. Using these you can draw polygons or polylines within your composition in just a few clicks.\nNew tools have also been added to allow editing nodes (ie move or remove nodes) and also to add new nodes to an existing shape. Composer polygon and polyline items can also be styled using all the symbol styles available for line and polygon layers!\nThis feature was funded by MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)\nThis feature was developed by Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)\nFeature: Relative links in composer labels ¶ Now labels and HTML boxes can contain relative URLs. If we don't have a base URL, the project file will be used as a base URL.\nThis feature was funded by MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)\nThis feature was developed by Patrick Valsecchi (Camptocamp)\nFeature: Embed atlas features into composer HTML source as GeoJSON ¶ This change makes the current atlas feature (and additionally all attributes of related child features) available to the source of a composer HTML item, allowing the item to dynamically adjust its rendered HTML in response to the feature's properties. An example use case is dynamically populating a HTML table with all the attributes of related child features for the atlas feature.\nTo use this, the HTML source must implement a \u0026quot;setFeature(feature)\u0026quot; JavaScript function. This function is called whenever the atlas feature changes, and is passed the atlas feature (and all related attributes) as a GeoJSON Feature.\nThis feature was funded by Canton of Zug, Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Parameterized svg support for composer svg images ¶ This change makes it possible to change an SVG files fill and outline colors, and outline width when using parameterised SVG files such as those included with QGIS. For more details on parameterised SVG files see this article.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Easier use of HTML in labels ¶ In QGIS 2.16, the base stylesheet of composer labels will automatically set the label font and margins to match the label's settings. This allows interactive choice of font, margins and colors and avoids the need to manually set these with CSS within the label HTML code.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Georeference outputs (eg PDF) from composer ¶ In QGIS 2.16 the map composer automatically georeferences outputs (when the output format makes this possible, eg TIF and PDF).\nThe existing option to create a world file has been separated from the map selection for georeferencing. The new behaviour is to always georeference outputs, and only create the separate world file if that option is checked.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Composer maps now auto-update with presets ¶ When a composer map is set to follow a style preset, it will automatically be updated whenever the style is changed.\nA new option has been added in composer map properties: \u0026quot;Follow visibility preset\u0026quot; with a combo box to choose the active preset. This is an alternative to \u0026quot;lock layers\u0026quot; (and \u0026quot;lock layer styles\u0026quot;) functionality which just copy a preset's configuration, while this new option creates a link to the preset.\nThe difference is that when a preset is updated, composer map will automatically pick the new configuration when following the preset, while there is no update if \u0026quot;lock layers\u0026quot; (and \u0026quot;lock layer styles\u0026quot;) option is used.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: Named parameters in expressions ¶ In QGIS 2.16 the expression engine now supports use of named parameters. This means that instead of writing the cryptic expression: clamp(1,2,3) you can use: clamp( min:=1, value:=2, max:=3). This change also allows arguments to be switched, eg: clamp( value:=2, max:=3, min:=1).\nUsing named parameters helps clarify what the arguments for an expression function refer to, which is helpful when you are trying to interpret an expression at a later date!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: More distance units ¶ The choice of distance units has been widened, with new options including kilometers, yards and miles. Using these units prevents the need for manual conversion of distances (eg feet to miles).\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Changes to expressions ¶ Support date + time = datetime calculations Support for date - date, time - time and datetime - datetime type calculations which return an interval. New char() function for returning a matching character by unicode value Feature: Statistics for string and date fields ¶ The statistical summary dock can now calculate aggregate statistics for string and date fields.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Show curve point radius in info tool ¶ If you click on a curved line using the info tool, QGIS will now display the radius in the info tool.\nThis feature was developed by Marco Hugentobler\nFeature: Aggregate support for expressions ¶ QGIS 2.16 adds support for a several types of aggregates to the expression engine. These include:\nAggregates within the current layer, eg sum(\u0026quot;passengers\u0026quot;) Supports sub expressions (ie sum(\u0026quot;passengers\u0026quot;/2) ), group by ( sum(\u0026quot;passengers\u0026quot;, group_by:=\u0026quot;line_segment\u0026quot;) ), and optional filters ( sum(\u0026quot;passengers\u0026quot;, filter:= \u0026quot;station_class\u0026quot; \u0026gt; 3 ) ) Relational aggregates, which calculate an aggregate over all matching child features from a relation, eg relation_aggregate( 'my_relation', 'mean', \u0026quot;some_child_field\u0026quot; ) A summary aggregate function, for calculating aggregates on other layers. Eg aggregate('rail_station_layer','sum',\u0026quot;passengers\u0026quot;). The summary aggregate function supports an optional filter, making it possible to calculate things like: aggregate('rail_stations','sum',\u0026quot;passengers\u0026quot;, intersects(@atlas_geometry, $geometry ) ) for calculating the total number of passengers for the stations inside the current atlas feature In all cases the calculations are cached inside the expression context, so they only need to be calculated once for each set of expression evaluations.\nThis feature was funded by Canton of Zug, Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: fTools plugin has been replaced with Processing algorithms ¶ fTools is a core plugin that for many years has provided the tools found in the Vector menu in QGIS. With the advent of the QGIS processing framework, the fTools began to represent a duplication of effort, and many of the tools have been improved in their Processing equivalents. To address, the fTools plugin has been removed from QGIS and equivalent menu entries have been added to the vector menu, pointing to the Processing framework tools that achieve the same thing.\nThis feature was developed by Alex Bruy\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Set point locations by clicking on canvas ¶ Processing parameters expecting a point location can now be set via clicking a location on the map canvas. Previously, coordinates had to be manually entered.\nThis feature was developed by Alex Bruy\nFeature: Support for expressions and variables ¶ Inputs and outputs in algorithm dialogs now support QGIS expressions and variables.\nThis feature was developed by Victor Olaya\nFeature: Preconfigured algorithms ¶ Algorithms with preconfigured parameters can now be added to the Processing toolbox, as a shortcut for a given process.\nThis feature was developed by Victor Olaya\nFeature: Create a plugin with script-based algorithms from the toolbox ¶ Previously, the only way to create a QGIS plugin which added new algorithms to Processing was to manually develop those algorithms and create a new algorithm provider. Now, algorithms can be written as simple Processing scripts, and a plugin containing them can be created directly from the Processing Toolbox. That plugin can be then distributed as a regular plugin, and will extend Processing when active.\nThis feature was developed by Victor Olaya\nFeature: Use of authentication manager in PostGIS related algorithms ¶ PostGIS related algorithms now use QGIS authentication manager to get credentials for PostGIS database.\nIn case an authentication method has been set on PostGIS connection, user will be asked for his master password. In case no authentication method has been set on connection, credentials will be taken from credentials cache or, if not found there, asked to the user and stored in credentials cache for further use. With this, it is not longer necessary to store clear passwords in connection settings to use PostGIS related algorithms.\nThis feature was funded by MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)\nThis feature was developed by Arnaud Morvan (Camptocamp)\nFeature: Support for writing tables with no geometry ¶ The OutputVector algorithm now supports writing geometryless tables.\nFor now, this has only been applied on Refactor Fields algorithm but could easily extended to other attributes related algorithms.\nThis feature was funded by MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)\nThis feature was developed by Arnaud Morvan (Camptocamp)\nFeature: Additional GRASS algorithms in processing ¶ For this release, QGIS Processing now includes every vector, raster and imagery algorithms from GRASS7. Now, there are more than 300 algorithms for you to use directly from the QGIS interface. You have all the power of GRASS7 directly incorporated into QGIS and you can mix GRASS7 algorithms with all other Processing algorithms without having to use a GRASS7 database.\nSome unit tests (mostly for raster and imagery algorithms) have also been included for some algorithms, making bug detection easier to handle and to process.\nNote that, for the moment, GRASS7 Processing algorithms can only use and produce Shapefile vector layers and GeoTiff rasters. There is also a limit for some GRASS7 raster algorithms (all of the algorithms that are manipulating color tables) which duplicate raster layers to temporary directories. Depending on the size of your source rasters, you will probably need some disk space to handle them.\nThis feature was developed by Médéric Ribreux\nData Providers ¶ Feature: OGR datasets are opened in read-only mode by default ¶ Allows concurrent editing of Shapefiles and Tabfiles in both QGIS \u0026amp; MapInfo.\nThis feature was funded by MEEM (French Ministry of Sustainable Development)\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nFeature: Improved handling of Postgres DOMAIN type fields ¶ QGIS now shows the correct domain type as field type name, and is able to correctly determine the length and precision of domain types. See the PostgreSQL documentation to find more information about DOMAIN types.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Make readOnly mode of vector layers configurable in project ¶ Using this option, you can prevent users from inadvertently editing layers. Go to Project properties -\u0026gt; Identify layers to configure which layers should be presented as read only.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Support for DB2 databases ¶ This feature was developed by David Adler\nFeature: Refresh Postgres materialized views in db manager ¶ Feature: OGR FID attribute shown ¶ QGIS now exposes the OGR FID as first attribute when it is meaningful, eg for GPKG and other database based drivers.\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nFeature: ArcGIS Map and Feature REST services ¶ QGIS is now able to connect to ArcGIS REST services.\nYou can connect to ArcGIS Feature services (WFS equivalent in ESRI world) and ArcGIS Map services (WMS equivalent). The provider allows you to read maps and vector layers from those services.\nThis feature is quite convenient for users who would like to switch from an ESRI GIS stack without losing anything they already have built on private or public map services. You can also connect to public services provided by ESRI.\nThis feature was funded by Sourcepole QGIS Enterprise\nThis feature was developed by Sandro Mani, Sourcepole\nFeature: Save styles in MS SQL and Oracle databases ¶ This feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer and Christian Frugard\nFeature: Rename fields in layers ¶ In QGIS 2.16 you can now rename fields in Postgres, Oracle, OGR and memory layers by double clicking the field name in the layer properties window.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Basic support for Oracle Workspace Manager ¶ Support has been added for Oracle Workspace Manager when using the Oracle Provider.\nSee https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/d161612bd216d36dc23ab2307636cf1bc0a36192\nThis feature was funded by ENEL\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer for Faunalia\nFeature: Massive improvements to WFS Provider ¶ QGIS 2.16 brings an overhaul of the WFS provider, including\nVersion autodetection On-disk caching of downloaded features Background download and progressive rendering WFS 1.1 and 2.0 support WFS 2.0 GetFeature paging Add provider tests Support for WFS 2.0 joins URI parameter with sql with SELECT / FROM / JOIN / WHERE / ORDER BY clauses Handle DateTime fields Enable \u0026quot;Only request features overlapping the view extent\u0026quot; by default (and memorize the settings) Support for additional/mixed geometry types (CurvePolygon, CompoundCurve) More tolerance for non-conforming WFS servers This feature was funded by Land Information New Zealand and Canton of Zug, Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nFeature: Generation of default values on Postgres layers \u0026quot;just in time\u0026quot; ¶ The expression used to generate default values for a field on the postgres database are currently being printed on the feature form.\nnextval('serial') A new option in the \u0026quot;project properties\u0026quot; (tab \u0026quot;Data Sources\u0026quot;) allows evaluating the expression before opening the form and will directly print the new value in the feature form.\n23 The main advantage of this improvement, is that one can now directly create and link records of related tables before having to save the data first, because the primary key is already present before the feature is saved.\nThis feature was funded by Canton of Zug, Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Redlining support in GetMap and GetPrint ¶ This feature was funded by Canton of Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Marco Hugentobler, Sourcepole\nFeature: Default datum transformation for server ¶ Will have to dig through https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/70863ecaf0ccfcb538e3892af4b528304b21a0a2 to find details\nThis feature was developed by Marco Hugentobler (Sourcepole)\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Refreshed globe plugin ¶ Update to OsgEarth 2.8 Rewrite of QGIS globe tile driver Rewrite of synchronization logic between 2D and 3D Migration to new geometry kernel Support for multiple background layers Menus embedded in globe window Independent layer selection for globe Port of Mathias Kuhns master thesis work from QGIS 2.1/OsgEarth 2.4 This feature was funded by Sourcepole QGIS Enterprise\nThis feature was developed by Sandro Mani, Sourcepole\nFeature: Globe: Extrude objects ¶ Allow extruding objects into the 3rd dimension.\nEither by a fixed value or by an attribute or expression.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: API: Add pages to vector layer properties ¶ Allow adding additional pages to the vector layer properties dialog.\nThis allows putting the configuration for layer related options provided by a plugin directly where they belong for a better user experience.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Globe: Vector support ¶ When displaying layers on globe, preserve vector data.\nThis feature was funded by Master Thesis UZH\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Globe: Vertical exaggeration for DTM ¶ Because sometimes it's just nice to exaggerate about the size.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Embedded widgets in layer tree ¶ This allows definition of widgets embedded into layer tree for individual layers in the layer properties dialog (in new Legend tab). The idea is to have a way to quickly access to some actions that are often used with a layer.\nThe implementation comes with transparency widget, in the future there may be more standard widgets coming, e.g. to setup filtering, selection, style or other stuff. The API allows plugins to register their own widgets, which will be useful for various domain specific plugins to assign custom widgets to layers they manage.\nThis feature was developed by Martian Dobias\nFeature: Plugins can add pages to vector layer properties ¶ This feature was developed by Sandro Mani (Sourcepole)\nFeature: New PyQGIS classes in 2.16 ¶ New core classes ¶ QgsComposerNodesItem -an abstract base class for composer items which provides generic methods for nodes based shapes such as polygons or polylines QgsComposerPolygon - a composer item for polygon shapes QgsComposerPolyline -a composer item for polyline shapes QgsGroupUngroupItemsCommand -a composer undo command class for grouping / ungrouping composer items QgsConstWkbSimplifierPtr -WKB reader which simplifies geometries on the fly QgsAction - a utility class that encapsulates an action based on vector attributes QgsActionManager - stores and manages actions associated with a layer QgsAggregateCalculator -a utility class for calculating aggregates for a field (or expression) over the features from a vector layer QgsAttributeTableConfig -a container for configuration of the attribute table for a vector layer QgsDateTimeStatisticalSummary -calculator for summary statistics and aggregates for a list of datetimes QgsInterval - a representation of the interval between two datetime values QgsJSONExporter - handles exporting QgsFeature features to GeoJSON features QgsJSONUtils - helper utilities for working with JSON and GeoJSON conversions QgsRuntimeProfiler -simple profiler for timing code paths during execution QgsSQLStatement - utility class for parsing SQL statements QgsStringStatisticalSummary -calculator for summary statistics and aggregates for a list of strings QgsHillshadeRenderer - a renderer for generating live hillshade models QgsArrowSymbolLayer -line symbol layer used for representing lines as arrows QgsNullSymbolRenderer -a renderer which draws no symbols for features by default, but allows for labeling and diagrams for the layer QgsSimpleMarkerSymbolLayerBase -abstract base class for simple marker symbol layers.

KG - General ¶ Feature: Automatic links in identify results ¶ Any http or mailto links within attribute values will now automatically be converted to clickable links within the identify results panel.\nThis feature was developed by Sandro Mani (Sourcepole)\nFeature: Mouse wheel over color dialog sliders ¶ In QGIS 2.18 you can now scroll the mouse wheel over any of the sliders within the color picker dialog to increment the value by small amounts. This is a handy shortcut for small tweaks to color components.\nThis feature was funded by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add custom color schemes to color button drop down menu ¶ QGIS 2.18 adds the ability for users to set whether a user created color scheme should show up in the color button drop-down menus. This setting is controlled through the color picker dialog, on the lists tab. Just add a new color scheme, then from the scheme menu tick the new \u0026quot;show in buttons\u0026quot; option. It's a handy shortcut if you have sets of common palettes and want them to be instantly available through the color menu.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Color picker is now embedded in layer style panel ¶ In QGIS 2.18 clicking a color button inside the layer style panel causes the color picker dialog to be opened inside the style panel itself rather than as a separate dialog. This allows for interactive modification of colors with immediate preview of the result.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Substitution list support for labeling ¶ Adds the ability to specify a list of text substitutes to make which apply to label text. Eg abbrevating street types.\nUsers can export and import lists of substitutes to make reuse and sharing easier.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved line label placement algorithm ¶ The parallel labeling mode for line layers has been greatly improved, with a new algorithm which avoids placing labels over jagged parts of the feature geometries.\nThis feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Label polygons using curved labels along perimeter ¶ This adds a new mode for labeling polygons where the perimeter of the polygon is labeled using curved labeling.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nRendering ¶ Feature: Preview of raster tiles (WMTS and XYZ layers) ¶ In previous versions of QGIS, users had to wait until download of all tiles of a layer has finished in order to view the resulting map. This has now been fixed and the tiles show up in map canvas immediately as they get downloaded, improving the user experience by greatly lowering the time until something is shown. Moreover, previously downloaded tiles from lower or higher resolutions may be used for the preview functionality in the areas where the tiles with correct resolution have not been downloaded yet.\nThis feature was funded by Land Information New Zealand\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Cancellable rendering of rasters (WMS, WMTS, WCS and XYZ layers) ¶ This enhancement improves user experience when working with raster layers coming from remote servers. Previously one would need to wait until downloads are fully complete in order to be able to zoom or pan the map again, because the user interface would stay frozen in the meanwhile. This is now fixed by the fact that the rendering of raster layers can be cancelled any time.\nThis feature was funded by Land Information New Zealand\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nData Management ¶ Feature: Add flag to only copy selected features ¶ The offline editing plugins is a default plugin that ships with QGIS and allows you to offline a remote dataset (e.g. from a database), edit it in the field, and then resynchonise it when you get back to your office. This extends the offline editing possibilities to only work on subset of large layers.\nThis feature was funded by DB Fahrwegdienste GmbH\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Allow controlling labels for individual edit widgets ¶ Allow controlling labels for individual edit widgets in a form. In the drag and drop designer, a double click on an item will allow controlling if the label should be shown for each item individually.\nIn addition it is possible to configure if the link/unlink buttons are shown in relation reference widget, which is useful to hide in 1:n relations where a child can't exist without its parents.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Zug, GIS-Fachstelle\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Conditional visibility for tabs and group boxes ¶ This adds a new configuration option to conditionally show or hide tabs and groupboxes in drag and drop designer forms.\nConfiguration is done via a double click in the designer tree in the fields configuration interface.\nAn expression can be entered to control the visibility. The expression will be re-evaluated everytime values in the form change and the tab or groupbox shown/hidden accordingly.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Client side default field values ¶ Allows an expression to be set for a vector layer field which is used to evaluate a default value for this field. Default value expressions can utilise properties of the feature which exist at the time of calling, such as digitized geometries. Expression variables can also be used in default value expressions, making it easy to eg insert a user's name, the current datetime, project path, etc.\nThis feature was funded by DB Fahrwegdienste GmbH\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: True North Arrows ¶ QGIS 2.18 adds support for orienting north arrows in the composer to True North. Previously all arrows were aligned to grid north, which is unsuitable for polar regions or non-north up projections (such as some South African projection systems). Now, you can choose to orient arrows to either grid north or true north. There's also an optional offset angle, which can be used to specify a grid convergence to make your arrows orient to magnetic north!\nThis feature was funded by Norwegian Polar Institute's Quantarctica project\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Point on surface algorithm ¶ This new algorithm is similar to the centroids algorithm, but where a centroid may fall outside its corresponding feature the 'Point on surface' algorithm is guaranteed to create a point which is inside the corresponding polygon feature (or touching the corresponding line feature for line layers).\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Processing dissolve algorithm accepts multiple fields ¶ The dissolve algorithm now allows you to dissolve based on more than one field value. In previous QGIS versions a dissolve could only group features by a single field value.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Optimised processing clip algorithm ¶ The processing clip algorithm has been optimised for common use scenarios, resulting in dramatic speedups for clipping operations. For example:\nClipping a roads layer with 1 million lines against 2 polygons\n| Earlier versions: 5 mins 30 seconds | QGIS 2.18: 10 seconds\nClipping a 5 million point address layer against 2 polygons\n| Earlier versions: 50 minutes | QGIS 2.18: 30 seconds\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Bounding boxes algorithm ¶ This new algorithm calculates the bounding box (envelope) of each feature in the input layer.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Merge connected lines algorithm ¶ This algorithm joins all the connected parts of MultiLineString geometries into single LineString geometries. If any parts of the input MultiLineString geometries are not connected, the resultant geometry will be a MultiLineString containing any lines which could be merged and any non-connected line parts.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Geometry boundary algorithm ¶ This new algorithm returns the closure of the combinatorial boundary of the input geometries (ie the topological boundary of the geometry). For instance, a polygon geometry will have a boundary consisting of the linestrings for each ring in the polygon, and a line geometry will have a boundary consisting of the start and end points of the line. This algorithm is only valid for polygon or line layers.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Native support of XYZ tile layers ¶ Raster tiles in XYZ format are now natively supported within WMS data providers, allowing users to display basemaps from other sources without requiring third-party plugins like QuickMapServices or OpenLayers anymore.\nTo add connections to XYZ layers, just open browser dock widget, look for item called \u0026quot;Tile Server (XYZ)\u0026quot; and right click it to get a popup menu with \u0026quot;New connection\u0026quot; action. You will be asked for URL, in which {x}, {y}, {z} will be replaced by the actual tile numbers according to the current map view. For example, to add OpenStreetMap base map, one may use this URL: http://c.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\nThe data provider also supports encoding of XYZ tile numbers into \u0026quot;quadkeys\u0026quot; used by Bing. Simply use {q} instead of {x}, {y} and {z} in the URL.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Possibility to segmentize feature info geometry in server ¶ Necessary for geometries that contain curves (CircularArc, CompoundCurve, CurvePolygon), but the web client (e.g. QGIS Web Client) can't handle the display of these geometry types.\nThis feature can be enabled in the \u0026quot;OWS server\u0026quot; tab in the \u0026quot;Project Properties\u0026quot; dialogue.\nThis feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Marco Hugentobler (Sourcepole)\nPlugins ¶ Feature: DB Manager: Add the ability to update SQL Layer ¶ With this feature the user can update the layer datasource if it's based on an SQL request.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by 3Liz\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Expose GEOS linear referencing function to QgsGeometry ¶ A new function QgsGeometry::lineLocatePoint() has been added for retrieving the distance along a linestring to the nearest position on the linestring to a given point.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New PyQGIS classes in 2.18 ¶ New core classes ¶ QgsAnnotation - an interface for annotation items which are drawn over a map QgsFeedback - a base class for feedback objects to be used for cancellation of something running in a worker thread QgsOptionalExpression - an expression with an additional enabled flag New GUI classes, Reusable widgets ¶ QgsExpressionLineEdit - includes a line edit for entering expressions together with a button to open the expression creation dialog. This widget is designed for use in contexts where no layer fields are available for use in an expression and space is constrained. QgsTabWidget - similar to QTabWidget but with additional methods to temporarily hide/show tabs Feature: New expression functions ¶ QGIS 2.18 adds several new expression functions, including functions for angle/distance interpolation.\nline_merge: merges a MultiLineString geometry into connected LineStrings boundary: returns a geometry's topological boundary, ie for polygons this is a MultiLineString representing the polygon's rings angle_at_vertex: returns the average (bisector) angle to a geometry at a specified vertex index distance_to_vertex: returns distance along geometry to a specified vertex index line_interpolate_angle: calculates the angle parallel to a geometry at the specified distance along the geometry line_interpolate_point: returns a point on line at distance line_locate_point: returns distance along line to nearest line location closest to specified point This feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog218/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 2.18"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 2.2 ¶ Release date: 2014-02-22\nChange log for the next release of QGIS 2.2.0. The emphasis on this release has been very much on polish and performance - we have added many new features, tweaks and enhancements to make the user interface more consistent and professional looking (and hopefully easier to use).

To enable this, use the Settings -\u0026gt; Options -\u0026gt; Map Tools option panel.\nData Providers ¶ Feature: One to many relations support ¶ This release sports the ability to define 1:n relations. The relations are defined in the project properties dialog. Once relations exist for a layer, a new user interface element in the form view (e.g. when identifying a feature and opening its form) will list the related entities. This provides a powerful way to express e.g. the inspection history on a length of pipeline or road segment. You can find out more about relations support here.\nFeature: DXF Export tool ¶ A new tool for exporting DXF's has been added to the Project menu\nFeature: Paste as new vector layer ¶ It is a common activity in a GIS to create a sub-selection and then to create a new layer from the selection. In QGIS you can already do save selection as to save a layer from your selection, and now offers functionality that allows you to create a new file or memory layer from whatever is in your clipboard. Simply select some features, copy them to your clipboard and then do Edit -\u0026gt; Paste features as and choose either New vector layer or New memory layer from the submenu. The best part of this new feature is that if you have some Well Known Text (WKT) features in your clipboard from another app, you can simply paste them into QGIS as a new layer now.\nFeature: WMS legend graphic in table of contents and composer ¶ Prior to QGIS 2.2 the WMS data provider was not able to display a legend in the table of contents' layer list. Similarly no legend could be displayed in the map composer. QGIS 2.2 addresses both of these issues.\nClicking on the layer's legend will open a frame with the legend at full resolution. The legend will display contextual information based on your current scale. The WMS legend will be shown only if the WMS server has GetLegendGraphic capability. Legend resolution can be modified changing Canvas \u0026amp; Legend options.\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Fill ring digitizing tool ¶ This new tool is used to cut holes in polygons and automatically fill them with new features. If you hold down Ctrl when finalising the feature, the attributes will be taken from parent feature.\nGeneral ¶ Feature: Recent expressions saved ¶ The expression builder will now remember the last 20 used expressions.\nFeature: Paste WKT from clipboard ¶ QGIS can now paste and create a new feature based on WKT that is found in the clipboard. Simply copy some WKT and paste into a editable layer. You can also create a new layer by selecting Edit -\u0026gt; Paste As -\u0026gt; New Memory Layer\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: Zebra map border improvements ¶ You can now set the colours of the Zebra border on the map element in the map composer.\nFeature: Element rotation support ¶ Every type of element in the composer can now be rotated, including scale bars, tables and legends. For example you can rotate a label on the composition so that it fits into your page layout better (as illustrated). Resizing of rotated elements has also been improved.\nFeature: Composer scale added and ruler improvements ¶ The appearance of rulers has been improved by adjusting the scale logic and by adding smaller ruler divisions, and by making vertical rulers use rotated text. There is also a new composer action for hiding/showing rulers. You can now quickly zoom to 100% page scale using the new Zoom to 100% tool on the toolbar. The composer window now lets you quickly switch the page scaling via a new scale combobox in the status bar. In addition a new indicator has been added to show you the precise pixel position of your cursor. The Close and Help buttons have been removed from the bottom of the composer window to give you the maximum amount of screen space for working with your compositions.\nFeature: World file generation ¶ In the composer you can now create georefenced maps! Simply ensure that you choose the correct map element in the Composition tab and then export your map as a PNG file. An accompanying world file will be written, allowing you to load your exported composition in QGIS as a raster layer.\nFeature: Working with multiple items ¶ Support has been added for moving and resizing multiple items simultaneously. You can now hold shift while resizing to maintain an item's ratio while resizing, or hold control to resize from the item's centre. Shortcut key also apply to moving items, so holding shift while moving an item constrains the movement to horizontal or vertical movement, and holding control temporarily disables item snapping. You can also hold shift while pressing a cursor key to shift all selected items by a larger amount.\nFeature: Atlas enhancements ¶ You can now preview the individual pages of the map atlas that will be generated in composer. While in atlas preview mode you can output the current page without outputting the entire atlas. You can also tweak the map extent or scale for each feature while previewing the atlas page. Atlas map settings have been moved from the atlas panel to the map properties panel, so now more than one map can be controlled by the atlas generation. There's a new option to automatically centre an overview map, which comes in handy when creating atlas based maps. More context information is now available so that you can adjust your symbology based on whether the feature is the current atlas feature or not. See this article for more info.\nFeature: Improved item selection ¶ You can now select more then one item by clicking and dragging a box to select them, and there's shortcuts for adding to a selection (holding shift while dragging), subtracting from a selection (hold control while dragging) and switching to \u0026quot;within\u0026quot; selection mode (hold alt while dragging). Shift clicking an already selected item will remove it from the selection. There's also shortcuts and menu items for selecting all items, clearing a selection, and inverting a selection. It's also possible now to select items which are hidden below other items by control-clicking an item, or by using \u0026quot;Select next item above/below\u0026quot; in the new composer Edit menu.\nFeature: Better navigation of compositions ¶ QGIS 2.2 includes many improvements to help you navigate your compositions. You can now zoom in or out from a composition by using the mouse scroll wheel. A dedicated pan tool has been added which allows you to drag the composition around, and you can also switch immediately to pan mode by holding the space bar or the by holding the mouse scroll wheel. There's also a new zoom tool which allows you to precisely zoom to a specific area of your composition. You can also switch to zoom mode at any time by pressing and holding control-space and drawing a zoom region on the composition.\nFeature: Improved styling of pages and shapes ¶ You can now control the style of the composition background using the full range of QGIS' symbology options. It's now possible to export compositions with a transparent (or semi-transparent) background. Shape items (rectangles, triangles and ellipses) can also be styled using the same options as polygon map layers. You can even style the page background or shapes by using data defined settings based on the current atlas feature! There's also a new option for rounding the corners of rectangle shapes.\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: WCS Support added to QGIS Server ¶ QGIS-Server already supports standards : Web Map Service (WMS version 1.3.0 and 1.1.1) and Web Feature Service (WFS version 1.0.0) and Web Feature Service with Transaction (WFS-T). With this new release of QGIS, you can now serve raster layers using the Web Coverage Service (WCS version 1.0.0)) standard.\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Gradient fill support ¶ The new gradient fill feature lets you create even better cartography than ever before. The feature has numerous options providing for great flexibility in how you apply gradients to your features. These include:\nTwo colour or ramp based fills Canvas or object based origin for your gradients Gradients originating from the centroid of a feature Conical, linear and radial gradient types Data defined options (to use an expression or a table column) for all gradient properties. Read more about how to use gradient fills here.\nFeature: Label support for palleted rasters ¶ Rasters that use a fixed colour pallette (typical for e.g. a land cover map) can now have category labels assigned which will be shown in the map legend and in the composer legend.\nFeature: Colour ramps can be inverted ¶ A new option has been added to symbology dialogs that deal with colour ramps to allow you to invert the colour ramp when it is created.\nFeature: Copy and Paste in Rule based renderer ¶ In the rule based renderer, you can now right click on a rule and then copy and paste the rule as a new rule.\nFeature: On the fly feature generalisation ¶ QGIS 2.2 introduces support for on the fly feature generalisation. This can improve rendering times when drawing many complex features at small scales. This feature can be enabled or disabled in the layer settings. There is also a new global setting that enables generalisation by default for newly added layers. Note: Feature generalisation may introduce artefacts into your rendered output in some cases. These may include slivers between polygons and inaccurate rendering when using offset based symbol layers.\nFeature: Anchor points can be set for marker layers ¶ When defining symbology with marker layers (e.g. a point layer symbolized with SVG markers) you can now specify what part of the image should correspond to the 'anchor point'. For example you can indicate that the bottom-left corner of the image should coincide with the position of the feature. You can also use the data defined properties to have this property set at render time based on an attribute in the data table for that layer (or an arbitrary expression).\nFeature: Thematic maps based on expressions ¶ Categorized and Graduated thematic maps can now be created using the result of an expression. In the properties dialog for vector layers the attribute chooser has been augmented with an expression builder. So now you no longer need to write the classification attribute to a new column in your attribute table if you want the classification attribute to be a composite of multiple fields, or a formula of some sort.\nFeature: Expression support in symbol diagrams for size and attributes ¶ You can now use an expression to define the size and attributes when using the diagramming capabilities of QGIS. For more info see the Pull Request here Pull 1039\nFeature: Else rule in rule based renderer ¶ The Rule based renderer now supports a ELSE rule that will be run if none of the other rules on that level match. Else rules can be nested just like any other rules.\nAn example might be:\n| type = 'water' (style grey) | ELSE (style red)\nFeature: Inner stroke support for polygons ¶ Support has been added for polygon strokes to be limited to the interior of the polygon (so that it does not overflow into a neighbouring polygon).\nMore information on this feature can be found on the second part of this article.\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Improved properties dialogs ¶ All our properties dialogs have had their main property menus updated so they look slicker with a inverse coloured side bar. This is purely cosmetic but should make it easier to know what your current context is in a dialog.\nFeature: Expression dialog improvements ¶ We have made some tweaks to the expression dialog - power users can now hide the operator buttons. There are also now splitters between the function list and function help areas, and between the expression and function list area. See the original pull request for details.\nFeature: New keybindings ¶ We have updated the keyboard shortcuts in QGIS to make it more efficient to carry out repetitive tasks.\nctrl-d - Remove selected layers in table of contents \u0026gt; - Select next vertex when using the node tool \u0026lt; - Select previous vertex when using the node tool Delete or Backspace - delete the selected features (you can undo these actions), or a node when using the nodetool. F5 updates the canvas (instead of ctrl-r) See also Issue 9094 and Pull Request 1010 for more details.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog220/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 2.2"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 2.4 ¶ Release date: 2014-06-27\nChange log for the next release of QGIS 2.4.0.

This information provides metadata on each band. These metadata can be used to explain the name of each band. For example, the bands of a NetCDF file represents the temperature at a given depth. For the user, it is easier to select a band with depth information, rather than only the band number.\nFeature: Applying scale and offset to raster data ¶ In some raster datasources, data are stored as interger with a scale and an offset in the metadata. The scale and offset can be used to get the right data. QGIS applies its to raster data to provider to users right information for legend, histogram and identify.\nFeature: Quick field field calc bar in attribute table ¶ We have a great new feature for those working with calculated fields in vector attribute tables. The new quick calculation bar lets you update the values in a column in the attribute table quickly and easily.\nFeature: Colour preview modes in composer and map canvas ¶ A really innovative feature that has been added to 2.4 is support for grayscale and colour blindness previews. This allows you to visualise how people with colour blindness will perceive your cartography and map layout, or how your map will look if it's printed in grayscale. You can read more about this new feature here.\nFeature: QLR QGIS Layer files ¶ Added support for QGIS Layer Definition files or simply QLR (see http://nathanw.net/2014/03/12/qgis-qlr/). QLR file is a file that points to the data, contains all the styling, and other information. You can then just add this file and it will do all the other magic for you. QLR makes it easy to add same layer to multiple map documents, inheriting all of the properties which have been set and works with any layer supported in QGIS, expect special plugin layers.\nFeature: New expression functions ¶ We have some new functions available in the expression builder.\nbounding box (bounds) bounding box width \u0026amp; height (bounds_width/bounds_height) min/max x/y coordinates (xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax) new wordwrap function that returns a string wrapped to a maximum/minimum number of characters Feature: Copy, paste and drag and drop colours ¶ You can now copy, paste, drag and drop colours between any colour input widget in QGIS. See this article for more information on how this new feature works. Hex color codes and rgb strings can also be pasted on to colour buttons to allow importing colours from outside of QGIS.\nFeature: Multi-threaded rendering ¶ This is one feature we simply cannot do justice to with a screenshot -QGIS now supports multi-threaded rendering! What this means is that when drawing the map, QGIS will split the drawing work between all of the cores in your CPU, making the process more efficient and responsive. By responsive we mean that you no longer need to wait for the map view to update before you can pan or zoom again. Also the map display updates incrementally allowing you to see if the map is positioned correctly early on in the drawing process. Take a look at this article for a more detailed overview of the multi-threaded rendering system. You will find some options in the QGIS settings dialog that allow you to manage the behaviour of multi-threaded rendering.\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Label features multiple times ¶ Long lines (such as contour lines or roads) can now be repeatedly labeled at regular intervals. One can choose between mm and map units for specifying the repetition interval. At the time of the release there is still an issue with \u0026quot;merge connected lines to avoid duplicate\u0026quot; setting.\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: Improvements to composer picture items ¶ The image item in composer is now 'atlas friendly' - you can use an expression to define which image should be shown for each atlas page. You can also now set the resize mode (zoom, clip, stretch etc.) for the image in relation to its frame size and dimensions. You can also specify the placement of the image relative to its frame using the new placement item property.\nFeature: Predefined scales mode for atlas maps ¶ When working with atlas map items, you can now specify a predefined scale mode for the map. It will use the best fitting option from the list of predefined scales in you your project properties settings (see Project -\u0026gt; Project Properties -\u0026gt; General -\u0026gt; Project Scales to configure these predefined scales).\nFeature: Improved attribute tables in composer ¶ We have made a number of improvements to the ability to display tables in your composer layouts:\nSupport has been added for reordering columns within a table Added support for expression based columns You can now set the alignment of individual table columns, and also specify the alignment for the table's header cells Table contents can be filtered by an expression Feature: General composer improvements ¶ There are a number of additions to the map composer to make life easier while working in map composition mode:\nAdded button to view current map item extent in main map canvas Ability to export SVG images from composer with layers Set line join and cap style for scalebars Support for setting the line join style for item frames Feature: Improvements to HTML frames ¶ HTML Frames in the composer have been improved. There is a new add frame button which can be used to manually create multiple linked frames. We have also improved our page break logic making it less likely that you will get page breaks that cut through the middle of lines of text when paginating HTML frames.\nPlugins ¶ Feature: MetaSearch Catalogue Client Plugin ¶ MetaSearch is a QGIS plugin to interact with metadata catalogue services, supporting the OGC Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) standard. This plugin provides an easy and intuitive approach and user-friendly interface to searching metadata catalogues within QGIS and now ships by default with the QGIS core product.\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Shapeburst fill style ¶ We have a great new render in QGIS 2.4. The shapeburst renderer will allow you to fill polygons with a gradient extending from the line edge towards the polygon interior. You can read more about shapeburst here.\nFeature: Option to shift marker line placement ¶ When using a marker line along a line or polygon edge, you can now specify an offset so that the marker line starts a set distance from the beginning of the line. If a marker line is set to \u0026quot;first vertex\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;last vertex\u0026quot; mode, than this offset will control how far along the line from the vertex the marker is placed.\nFeature: New Inverted Polygon renderer ¶ A new renderer has been added for polygon features, allowing you to style everything outside your polygons. This can be useful for highlighting areas, or for creating cartographic masks. When used with new shapeburst style, you can now produce output as shown in the image for this entry.\nNote: The new version of plugin mask helps to easily create mask layers from the current selection, label features only in those areas, and generate an automatic mask in Atlas map generation.\nFeature: Saving and recovering styles with Spatialite layers ¶ In the previous version was possible to save style with postgres layers, now will be possible for Spatialite layers too. This functions allow to embed different styles inside a spatialite container simplifying sharing data and their presentation. A video tutorial of this funcionality can be found here http://pvanb.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/saving-layer-styles-to-your-spatialite-database/\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog240/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 2.4"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 2.6 ¶ Release date: 2014-10-31\nChange log for the next release of QGIS 2.6.0.

Now you can add virtual fields to your table which are based on an expression.\nFeature: Actions can now have an associated icon ¶ When creating a custom action for a vector layer, you can now define an icon to be used for the action too.\nFeature: Additional expressions types and options ¶ Allow using + for string concatenation. New keyword: attribute( feature, attribute_name ) - gets the specified attribute from a feature. New keyword: $currentfeature - returns the current feature. New keyword: $atlasfeature - returns the atlas feature. New keyword: getFeature - gets a matching feature from a layer. Feature: Classes within graduated and categorised renderers can be toggled ¶ You can now choose to disable certain classes in graduated and categorised renderers without actually removing them.\nFeature: Legend improvements ¶ The second phase of the legend / table of contents overhaul has been completed. This includes:\nAPI cleanup (for developers) Visibility groups of map layers in layer tree. This new toolbar button allows quick changes between the groups of layers that should be visible. Ability to manage layer groups from the legend toolbar The new legend filter option on the legend toolbar will remove legend items for any classes which are not currently in the view extent. This is an awesome improvement as it ensures that your map legend does not contain entries for items not currently in the map view. It is available in the main map legend and in map composer and for WMS layers. Rule-based renderer legends can now be displayed in a pseudo-tree Data Providers ¶ Feature: DXF export improvements ¶ tree view and attribute selection for layer assigment in dialog support fill polygons/HATCH represent texts as MTEXT instead of TEXT (including font, slant and weight) support for RGB colors when there's no exact color match use AutoCAD 2000 DXF (R15) instead of R12 remove R18 test methods Map Composer ¶ Feature: Control over hiding print composer items from prints/exports ¶ We have added a checkbox and data defined button for controlling whether an item is excluded from composer exports/printouts. If the item is unchecked it will be visible at composition design time only.\nFeature: Control over page printing for empty composer frames ¶ For table or HTML frames, a checkbox now controls whether the containing page should be exported when the frame is empty.\nFeature: Item tree panel ¶ The item tree panel in the map composer allows for selection of items, hiding/showing items, toggling lock status of items and double-clicking to edit item id. You can also use drag and drop to reorder items.\nFeature: More control over appearance of composer arrow/line items ¶ Lines can be styled using line symbol style dialog Arrow head fill and outline colors can be user defined Arrow head outline width can be user defined Feature: Data defined control of composer items ¶ Many properties of composer items can now be controlled using data binding. These include:\nTransparency and blend mode. Item rotation. Map scale, extents and rotation. Atlas feature margin. Item size and position. Page size, orientation and number of pages. Feature: Composer images can be specifed as remote URLS ¶ Picture items in the map composer now support remote urls as a picture source. This source can also be data defined.\nFeature: Composer Table improvements ¶ You can now set table header and content font colors. Tables can now be split across multiple frames, allowing their content to be distributed over columns or over different pages. Added option show headers on first frame, all frames, or no frames. Allow manual control of column widths. New options for table source, including current atlas feature and child features from a relation. Choice of behaviour for empty tables, include hiding the entire table, showing empty cells, or displaying a set message in the table body. Added a checkbox to filter table features to those which intersect the current atlas feature. Added checkbox to remove duplicate rows from table. Note that tables in existing projects are not automatically updated to the new table format which supports these features, and tables must be readded to a composition for the new settings to appear.\nFeature: Composer improvements ¶ The map composer (used to prepare printable map compositions) has received a number of improvements in QGIS 2.6.\nYou can now change the secondary fill color for scalebars Holding shift while drawing line/arrow items constrains drawing to horizontal, vertical or 45 degree angles Holding shift while drawing other new items constrains them to squares, holding alt causes item to be drawn from the center Right click no longer locks/unlocks items, this is now handled by the new items panel. Locked items can no longer be selected from the composer canvas, allowing for interaction with items below them. Holding alt while pressing cursor keys results in a 1px movement for items Removed the destructive 'Load from template' menu item, replace with a new non-destructive 'Add items from template' action Feature: Improved item snapping ¶ Snapping thresholds are now set in pixels, allowing for finer movement and resizing of items when zoomed in to a composition. Items within a group are no longer used for auto snap lines.\nFeature: Multiple overviews for a map item ¶ Sometimes it is useful to be able to show more than one overview frame for a map frame. For example if you want to show where your map is in local, regional and global context, using multiple overview maps can help you to achieve this. As of QGIS 2.6 you can now achieve this by assigning as many maps as you like to the 'overview' role in your composition.\nFeature: HTML item improvements ¶ There are a number of useful new options for the HTML composer item:\nOption for manual entry of HTML source QGIS expressions within HTML source can be evaluated prior to rendering HTML content Data defined URL for HTML source Allow for creating a user stylesheet to override HTML styles Feature: Composer map grid improvements ¶ You can now have multiple grids with different properties. You can mix reprojected grids and Lat/Long grids. You can use standard QGIS symbology grid lines etc. There is a new frame/annotations only grid style. Selecting this style causes only the frame and annotations to be drawn, with no grid lines or other markings over the map. There are now options for controlling which side of a map item the frame is drawn on. There are new tick styles for frames, with inner ticks, outer ticks and both inner and outer tick options. We have made improvements to grid annotations, including many new formats for annotations. Grid annotations now use the typographically correct prime and double prime symbols for grid annotations. Processing ¶ Feature: On-line collection of models and scripts ¶ Models and scripts can be downloaded from the online collection and installed directly from the Processing interface. The collection will be expanded with new scripts and models provided by Processing users.\nFeature: New modeler implementation ¶ The modeler has been rewritten, and now provides extra functionality such as allowing nested models with no depth limit. Models are now stored as JSON files. Backwards compatibility is kept, so all models can still be used. You can also now drag and drop items from the inputs and algorithms onto the modeler graph.\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: API changes for QGIS widgets ¶ In order to normalise the naming of QGIS widgets, some minor API changes have been made. Almost all edit widgets were renamed by adding \u0026quot;Wrapper\u0026quot; at the end of their names. In particular this concerns:\nQgsCheckboxWidget -\u0026gt; QgsCheckboxWidgetWrapper QgsClassificationWidget -\u0026gt; QgsClassificationWidgetWrapper QgsColorWidget -\u0026gt; QgsColorWidgetWrapper QgsEnumerationWidget -\u0026gt; QgsEnumerationWidgetWrapper QgsFilenameWidget -\u0026gt; QgsFilenameWidgetWrapper QgsHiddenWidget -\u0026gt; QgsHiddenWidgetWrapper QgsPhotoWidget -\u0026gt; QgsPhotoWidgetWrapper QgsRangeWidget -\u0026gt; QgsRangeWidgetWrapper QgsTexteditWidget -\u0026gt; QgsTexteditWrapper QgsUniquevalueWidget -\u0026gt; QgsUniquevalueWidgetWrapper QgsUuidWidget -\u0026gt; QgsUuidWidgetWrapper QgsValuemapWidget -\u0026gt; QgsValuemapWidgetWrapper QgsValuerelationWidget -\u0026gt; QgsValuerelationWidgetWrapper QgsWebviewWidget -\u0026gt; QgsWebviewWidgetWrapper QGIS Server ¶ Feature: Enhancements of searching with GetFeatureInfo request ¶ https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/8888c5f0c0e0ffdf23453a20addf6abaf125845d\nFeature: Add a precision setting for GetFeatureInfo geometry attributes ¶ Symbology ¶ Feature: Better random colour choice ¶ We have improved the random colour algorithm for classified renderer so that the colours generated are more visually distinct from each other.\nFeature: Symbology user interface improvements ¶ Where possible, properties of symbol layer are maintained when changing symbol layer type. Added an edit button for shapeburst and gradient color ramps. Automatic update of label and neighboring ranges boundaries. Classes are automatically converted from categorised and graduated classes when switching to rule based renderer. Added units and number of decimal places to graduated renderer labels. Improved responsiveness to changes in color ramp, inverted colour ramp, and other options in GUI. Retain symbol when switching between simple, graduated, categorized, and other renderers. Improved labelling of StdDev calculation mode. User Interface ¶ Feature: Syntax highlighting code editor ¶ For python script editors, expression builder, filter window, composer HTML and CSS editors\nFeature: Color palettes ¶ You can now define your own custom color palettes for use in QGIS.\nCustom user global color palette (in options dialog). Per project color palette (in project properties dialog). Colors are shown in color button menus and new color picker dialog. You can import/export colors to a GPL palette file. Feature: New color picker dialog ¶ There is a new custom QGIS color picker dialog. Features include: Sliders for hue, saturation, value, red, green, blue color components. Alpha slider. Option to copy/paste html color codes (in a variety of formats). Before/after color preview, with alpha preview. Interactive 2D color ramp widget. Hue wheel/triangle widget. Editable color palettes, including the ability to create new palettes and import/export colors to a GPL palette file. Live color sampler with option to sample over a set radius (OS support dependant). Supports interaction with other apps via drag and drop of colors (OS support dependant). Option to disable the dialog and use the native picker dialog instead. Feature: Single select feature tool merged into select by rectangle ¶ We have merged the single selection tool into the rectangle tool. If you want to select a single feature, simply enable the rectangle tool and then single click (rather than dragging a rectangle) a feature.\nFeature: Add layer to map canvas behaviour ¶ In many of QGIS' dialogs that generate a new layer, the 'Add layer to map canvas' checkbox is now checked by default so that the new layer automatically gets added to the map.\nFeature: Add icon size 48 and 64 ¶ For those using QGIS on touch devices (or if you just like big, chunky icons), you can now set the icons up to 64 x 64 pixels in size.\nFeature: New colour buttons ¶ This is probably one of the most useful new features in QGIS 2.6 -especially if you are involved a lot in cartography work. The colour button used everywhere in QGIS has been enhanced, with drop down menus, colour swatches, default colours, etc. Click on the drop down item to the right of the colour button to see the quick options. Click on the button to the left of the colour widget to see a standard colour chooser dialog.\nFeature: Context menu for identify tool ¶ When using the identify tool, you can now right click on the canvas to use the identify tool in context mode. In the menu that appears you can define which feature types you wish to identify (all all if you like).\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog260/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 2.6"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 2.8 ¶ Release date: 2015-02-20\nThis is the change log for the next release of QGIS - version 2.8 ' Wien'. Wien is German for 'Vienna' - host city to our developer meet up in November 2009 and again in March 2014.\nLong Term Release\nThis is a special release since it is designated an 'LTR' (Long Term Release). LTR releases will be supported with backported bug fixes for one year, and will be in permanent feature freeze (i.e. no new features will be added, only bug fixes and trivial updates).\nThe purpose of LTR releases is to provide a stable and less frequently changing platform for enterprises and organisations that do not want to deal with updating user skills, training materials etc. more than once per year. The success of the LTR is very much down to you, our beloved users - we need your support to help funding bug fixes and making sure in your support contracts with support providers specify that any bug fixes done on your behalf are applied to the LTR branch as well as our normal development branch.\nIf an LTR is important to you, please consider also directly supporting the QGIS project, or encourage your commercial provider to use LTR as a basis for your enterprise solution so that everyone may benefit from a stable platform that is being continuously improved and refined. Note that for users and organisations that like to live on the frontier, our regular four monthly releases will continue unabated.\nNew Features\nQGIS 2.8 is also a special release because it includes so many great new features, tweaks and enhancements to make the most popular Free desktop GIS even more feature filled and useful.\nWhenever new features are added to software they introduce the possibility of new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker.\nThanks\nWe would like to thank the developers, documenters, testers and all the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so).\nFrom the QGIS community we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate time, money or otherwise get involved in making QGIS more awesome, please wander along to qgis.org and lend a hand!\nFinally we would like to thank our official sponsors for the invaluable financial support they provide to this project:\nGOLD Sponsor: Asia Air Survey, Japan http://www.asiaairsurvey.com/ SILVER Sponsor: Sourcepole AG, Switzerland SILVER Sponsor: State of Vorarlberg, Austria SILVER Sponsor: Office of Public Works, Ireland, Ireland BRONZE Sponsor: GIS3W, Italy BRONZE Sponsor: www.molitec.it, Italy BRONZE Sponsor: www.argusoft.de, Germany BRONZE Sponsor: www.openrunner.com, France BRONZE Sponsor: GKG Kassel,(Dr.-Ing.

Sponsoring QGIS helps us to fund our six monthly developer meetings, maintain project infrastructure and fund bug fixing efforts.\nIf you enjoy using QGIS, please consider making a donation to support the project - either financial or of your time and skills! Lastly we would like to also take a moment to encourage you to fund a special campaign by one of our QGIS developers to get a working test suite for QGIS so that we can improve out quality assurance process and deliver you the best possible releases.\nQGIS is Free software and you are under no obligation to pay anything to use it - in fact we want to encourage people far and wide to use it regardless of what your financial or social status is - we believe empowering people with spatial decision making tools will result in a better society for all of humanity.\nGeneral Feature: Enter expressions into spin boxes Feature: Bookmarks can be imported/exported Feature: Improvements to expressions Feature: Continuous testing framework and QA improvements Analysis tools Feature: Measure dialog improvements Browser More responsive browser Data Providers Feature: Support for contextual WMS legend graphics Data management Feature: Custom prefix for joins Feature: Support for creation of temporary memory layers Feature: Support for calculations on selected rows Digitising Feature: Advanced digitizing tools Feature: Improved simplify tool Feature: Snapping improvements Layer Legend Feature: Show rule-based renderer's legend as a tree Map Composer Feature: Composer GUI Improvements Feature: Grid improvements Feature: Label item margins Plugins Feature: Python console improvements Processing Feature: New geometric predicate parameter type Feature: New algorithms Programmability Feature: Add comment functionality to expressions Feature: Custom expression function editor Feature: Qt5 support Feature: Bulk loading spatial index Feature: Run only the selected part of a SQL query QGIS Server Feature: Server python plugins Feature: Support for layer styles Feature: Add DescribeLayer Method to WMS Symbology Feature: Raster image fill type Feature: Live heatmap renderer Feature: Multiple styles per layer Feature: More data-defined symbology settings Feature: DXF export: improve marker symbol export Feature: Map rotation in canvas, improved rotation in composer User Interface Feature: Improved/consistent projection selection General ¶ Feature: Enter expressions into spin boxes ¶ When editing attributes in the attribute table or forms, you can now enter expressions directly into spin boxes, e.g. 5 * 2.5 and they will be automatically evaluated.\nFeature: Bookmarks can be imported/exported ¶ It is now possible to save / load your bookmarks to a file. This makes it easy to share bookmarked locations, or transfer them between computers.\nThis feature was developed by: Salvatore Larosa\nFeature: Improvements to expressions ¶ Integer division produces a double when required: Previously dividing two integers in an expression would always result in an integer value, i.e. 5 / 2 = 2. Now the result will always be double when required, so 5 / 2 = 2.5, which is much more expected for users. A new integer divide operator - // has been added to mimic the old behaviour, i.e. 5 // 2 = 2. New 'if()' function: There is now a new if(cond, true, false) expression Lazy evaluation for expressions Added get and transform geometry: These new keywords can be used with getFeature for some geometry tests like intersects, crosses, contains, etc. geometry - returns the feature's geometry transform - returns the transformed geometry Feature: Continuous testing framework and QA improvements ¶ In our ongoing quest to improve the stability and quality of QGIS, every commit is now tested against a growing test suite to identify regressions automatically. In the image on the right you can see the list of incoming pull requests on our GitHub page are now automatically annotated with a check or cross based on whether our test suite successfully ran on Travis.ci when the pull request is made or updated.\nWe are also now regularly performing Coverity scans of QGIS codebase. As a result of this, we have identified and fixed over 1000 flagged issues, including memory leaks and potential crashes. QGIS has a defect density of 0.01 wheras the average for programs of similar size is about 1.0.\nAnalysis tools ¶ Feature: Measure dialog improvements ¶ The measure tool has been improved so that you can now select which units should be used in the measure dialog. There is also a new info section in the dialog that shows which settings are being used during measurement calculations.\nBrowser ¶ More responsive browser ¶ In the QGIS Browser items are now expanded in their own threads, speeding up the load time of the browser and making the browser more responsive. Navigating PostGIS sources is now much faster in the browser. The animated snapshot to the right (click image to see the animation) shows the loading of two slow WMS servers in parallel . The browser's state (tree expansion) is restored on startup.\nThis feature was developed by: Radim Blazek\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Support for contextual WMS legend graphics ¶ If your WMS server supports contextual legends, you can make use of them in QGIS now too. Contextual legends are getLegendGraphic requests which return only the relevant legend for your current view extent, and thus do not include legend items for things you can't see in the current map.\nThis feature was funded by: Regione Toscana\nThis feature was developed by: Faunalia\nData management ¶ Feature: Custom prefix for joins ¶ You can now define a custom prefix in the joins manager in the layer properties dialog. When using a prefix, the attribute table in will show joined attribute names with your preferred prefix.\nFeature: Support for creation of temporary memory layers ¶ This release add support for creating new temporary scratch layers within QGIS core. Scratch layers can be created in the Layer --\u0026gt; Create layer --\u0026gt; New Temporary Scratch Layer menu option.\nFeature: Support for calculations on selected rows ¶ In the attribute table you can now do calculations on selected rows only thanks to the new button added to the field calculator bar.\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Advanced digitizing tools ¶ If you ever wished you could digitise lines exactly parallel or at right angles, lock lines to specific angles and so on in QGIS, now you can! The advanced digitizing tools is a port of the CADinput plugin and adds a new panel to QGIS. The panel becomes active when capturing new geometries or geometry parts\nFeature: Improved simplify tool ¶ The simplify tool has been overhauled, adding:\nOTF reprojection support user can specify exact tolerance (not just non-sense relative value) tolerance can be specified either in map units or layer units or pixels tolerance settings are stored in settings simplify multiple features at once (drag a rectangle instead of just clicking) support for multi-part features statistics about reduction of the number of vertices This feature was funded by: Tracks for Africa\nThis feature was developed by: Lutra Consulting in cooperation with Kartoza\nFeature: Snapping improvements ¶ There is a new snapping mode : snap to all layers which makes it quick to enable snapping between all layers. Also the underlying snapping architecture of QGIS has been overhauled making snapping much faster on large projects and improving the precision with which snapping takes place. ​There\u0026rsquo;s also less confusion with snapping tolerances being to map units or layer units, so those anticipated 1 metre tolerances don\u0026rsquo;t become 1 degree tolerances without you knowing.\nThis feature was funded by: Ville de Vevey, SITNyon and QGIS Usergroup Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by: Lutra Consulting\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: Show rule-based renderer's legend as a tree ¶ Advanced users who leverage QGIS's rule based renderer system will be pleased to see that the rules are now presented as a tree in the legend. Better still, each node in the tree can be toggled on/off individually providing for great flexibility in which sublayers get rendered in your map.\nThis feature was funded by: SIGE\nThis feature was developed by: Lutra Consulting in cooperation with Kartoza\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: Composer GUI Improvements ¶ View menu option to hide bounding boxes. This allows users to hide the bounding boxes for selected items within a composition. It's a handy feature for allowing interaction with items while previewing exactly how they will look when the composition is exported, without large boxes blocking the view. Full screen mode for composer Option to toggle display of panels in composer, available by both the view menu, using the shortcut F10 and by pressing Tab when the composer canvas is selected. It's useful for maximising the space when planning a map layout. Feature: Grid improvements ¶ In the composer you now have finer control of frame and annotation display. Previously, for rotated maps or reprojected grids, the composer would draw all coordinates for every map side. This resulted in a mix of latitude/y and longitude/x coordinates showing on a side. Now you can control whether you want all coordinates, latitude only or longitude only for each map frame side. Similar options have also been added for controlling how a map grid frame is divided.\nNew vertical descending direction for annotations. This change adds a new descending vertical direction mode for map grid annotations. Previously only ascending text was supported for vertical annotations.\nFeature: Label item margins ¶ You can now control both horizontal and vertical margins for label items. Previously only a single margin setting would apply to both horizontal and vertical margins. This change allows users to specify different horizontal and vertical margins. You can now specify negative margins for label items, allowing text to be drawn slightly outside of a label item's bounds. This is desirable for aligning label items with other items while allowing for optical margin alignment for the label type. Plugins ¶ Feature: Python console improvements ¶ You can now drag and drop python scripts into QGIS window and they will be executed automatically. We also added a toolbar icon to the plugins toolbar and a shortcut ( Ctrl-Alt-P ) for quick access to the python console.\nProcessing ¶ Feature: New geometric predicate parameter type ¶ With this new parameter type, used in Select by location, Extract by location and Join attributes by location algorithms, the user can select precisely the spatial operator to use.\nThis feature was funded by: French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy\nThis feature was developed by: Camptocamp\nFeature: New algorithms ¶ A number of new algorithms have been added to the processing framework:\nRegular points algorithm (addresses #5953) Symetrical difference algorithm (addresses #5953) Vector split algorithm (addresses #5953) Vector grid algorithm (addresses #5953) Hypsometric curves calculation algorithm Split lines with lines Refactor fields attributes manipulation algorithm Programmability ¶ Feature: Add comment functionality to expressions ¶ Comments can now be added to expressions using an SQL style -- prefix.\nFeature: Custom expression function editor ¶ You can now define custom expression functions in the expression widget. See this blog post for more details.\nFeature: Qt5 support ¶ QGIS can now be built using Qt5 libraries. Note that currently most binaries will still with Qt4 by default.\nFeature: Bulk loading spatial index ¶ In the API we have added support for bulk loading of spatial index. This is much faster way of initializing a spatial index. From python it is as simple as:\nindex = QgsSpatialIndex( layer.getFeatures() )\nFrom a simple test with 50K points in a memory layer:\nbulk loading ~ 100 ms\ninserting features ~ 600 ms\nThe index tree should be also in theory be better constructed and may result in faster lookups.\nFeature: Run only the selected part of a SQL query ¶ In the DB Manager SQL editor, it is now possible to highlight a portion of the SQL and only that portion will be executed when you press F5 or click the run button\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Server python plugins ¶ Python plugins support for QGIS server brings the power of python to server side, allowing for fast and efficient development and deployment of new features.\nThis feature was developed by: Alessandro Pasotti (ItOpen)\nFeature: Support for layer styles ¶ QGIS Server now supports predefined layer styles in GetMap requests QGIS Server now supports multiple styles in GetStyles request (see symbology section below) Feature: Add DescribeLayer Method to WMS ¶ Styled Layer Descriptor profile of the Web Map Service : DescribeLayer\nhttp://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld\nDefining a user-defined style requires information about the features being symbolized, or at least their feature/coverage type. Since user-defined styles can be applied to a named layer, there needs to be a mechanism by which a client can obtain feature/coverage-type information for a named layer. This is another example of bridging the gap between the WMS concepts of layers and styles and WFS/WCS concepts such as feature-type and coverage layer. To allow this, a WMS may optionally support the DescribeLayer request.\nDescribeLayer method has been thought to be a better approach than overloading the WMS capabilities document even more.\nFor each named layer, the description should indicate if it is indeed based on feature data and if so it should indicate the WFS/WCS (by a URL prefix) and the feature/coverage types. Note that it is perfectly valid for a named layer not to be describable in this way.\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Raster image fill type ¶ This new symbol layer type allows for filling polygons with a (tiled) raster image.\nOptions include (data defined) file name, opacity, image size (in pixels, mm or map units), coordinate mode (feature or view), and rotation.\nFeature: Live heatmap renderer ¶ The new heatmap vector layer renderer allows for live, dynamic heatmaps for point layers.\nOptions include specifying heatmap radius in pixels, mm or map units, choice of color ramp,weighting points by field, and a slider for selecting a tradeoff between render speed and quality.\nFeature: Multiple styles per layer ¶ It is now possible to set multiple styles for a layer and then easily toggle between them. This functionality is available in the legend context menu --\u0026gt; styles sub-menu where it is possible to add/remove styles and quickly switch between them. Layer sets remember styles, and different styles can also be applied to individual composer map items. The multiple styles defined are also available when the project is served via QGIS Server as a WMS layer. For more information on this see also this blog post.\nThis feature was funded by: Regione Toscana\nThis feature was developed by: Gis3W, Lutra Consulting\nFeature: More data-defined symbology settings ¶ The user interface for data defined symbology settings has been improved - moving the data defined option next to each data definable property (in keeping with other parts of QGIS such as the labeling properties). Also many new properties have been made data definable for symbology. This user interface improvement also provides a way to immediately see if a data defined override is defined as well as easier access to the data-defined settings.\nFeature: DXF export: improve marker symbol export ¶ The exporter functionality for DXF files has been improved, with better fidelity of exported marker symbols to the original QGIS symbology.\nFeature: Map rotation in canvas, improved rotation in composer ¶ This release includes preliminary support for rotation in the map canvas. You can rotate the canvas using the new rotation widget in the status bar. Rotation support has been extended into the map composer too so that it correctly handles labelling and symbology, etc.\nThis feature was funded by: Japan Space Imaging Corporation (JSI)\nThis feature was developed by: Faunalia\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Improved/consistent projection selection ¶ All dialogs now use a consistent projection selection widget, which allows for quickly selecting from recently used and standard project/QGIS projections.\n.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog28/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 2.8"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 3.0 ¶ Release date: 2018-02-23\nThe greatest QGIS release ever!

KG - Feature: Remove dxf2shp converter plugin ¶ This functionality is available in OGR and there is no longer a need for a dedicated QGIS plugin to do this task\nFeature: Remove orphaned oracle raster plugin ¶ Feature: remove TauDEM provider from core Processing ¶ TauDEM is quite specific set of tools and it requires installation of some additional tools. So we decide to turn it into separate provider, reducing core codebase size and maintenance efforts.\nFeature: More help and possibility to configure location of the QGIS help files ¶ More Help buttons for algorithms and dialogs are added and now pointing to the online QGIS Documentation.\nConfiguration allows to access context help stored online, in the organization network or on local computer. Also it is possible to combine different help sources.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Migrate Photo, WebView and FileName widgets to Attachment ¶ Feature: Removed otb and lidartools providers from processing ¶ The new logic will be to develop plugin providers that will be able to follow the external software lifecycle.\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Enable tabbed floating docks ¶ For qt \u0026gt; 5.6 builds, it is possible to drop several floating docks in the same floating window where they appear as tabs https://woboq.com/blog/qdockwidget-changes-in-56.html\nFeature: Add support for fine-resolution mouse wheel zooming ¶ Some mouse / pointer devices (notably on mac) have finer resolutions. They send mouse wheel events at a high frequency but with smaller delta values. Zooming with such devices was unusable for fast zoom actions. This has been fixed in 3.0.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: add search bar to the Configure Shortcuts dialog ¶ Supports search by action name and by shortcut\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Locator bar ¶ The Locator bar is a fast, always ready, generic and pluggable search facility in the Left Bottom corner of QGIS.\nCurrently it is able to search for algorithms, actions and layer names, but also to select a feature in current active layer by typing an attribute value.\nIt is 'easy' extendable, so everybody can create a QgsLocatorFilter for his/her national geocoding service or other search online or database search facility.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: More non-blocking, inline editing ¶ map unit scaling color brewer and limited random ramp editors editing colors in a color list inline in the style panel inline editing of colors and symbols in composer now shown inline in style panel\nFeature: Add an option to show user color schemes menus ¶ This adds the ability for users to set whether a user created color scheme should show up in the color button drop-down menus.\nIt's accessed through the color picker dialog, on the lists tab. Just add a new color scheme, then from the scheme menu tick the new \u0026quot;show in buttons\u0026quot; option.\nThis is handy if you have sets of common palettes and want them to be instantly available through the color menu.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Color setting for map canvas north arrow decoration ¶ Color setting has been added for all map canvas north arrow decoration.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Improved map canvas' save as image ¶ The map canvas' save as image function has been expanded and now offers users the possibility to tweak the scale, resolution, and extent on-the-fly. Extents can be restricted to a height-width ratio. A save as PDF function was also added to quickly export the map canvas into a resolution-independent PDF.\nThis feature was funded by Andreas Neumann (partial funding)\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Toggle visibility of opened panels in main window ¶ Accessible via: - View menu \u0026gt; Toggle Panels Visibility - Ctrl+Tab keyboard shortcut\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Improved consistency to the user interface ¶ This work sponsored by the QGIS grant program on \u0026quot;adding consistency to UI controls\u0026quot; is now complete and merged into master. The following tasks were done as part of this work:\nAll API regarding transparency/opacity/alpha was standardised to setOpacity() and opacity(). The methods take a double value between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque), keeping consistency with the Qt API. A new widget QgsOpacityWidget was created, and is now used everywhere through the UI where opacity is set. This ensures consistent behavior and look for opacity controls everywhere. Rotation has been standardised in the API and UI, so now rotation is always applied clockwise. All rotation widgets have been updated so they accept values from -360 to 360. 2.x Projects with labeling using rotation and data defined rotation are transparently upgraded upon opening in 3.0 Scale APIs have been made consistent throughout the QGIS API. The confusing mix of scale denominators vs real scales has been removed, with everything now operating on scale denominators. The behaviour of all scale range calls is standardised with a common meaning for min/max scales (and explicit api documentation regarding this) All scale controls now use the standard scale widgets for consistency across the UI Labeling now uses the same definition for min/max scale as the rest of the UI, and existing projects are transparently upgraded on opening in 3.0. Fixed most outstanding bugs relating to scale usage, including bugs breaking the rule based scale limits Thanks to the QGIS PSC and project donors for sponsoring this work and allowing it to proceed!\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Sponsors and Donors\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Open layers in a single group ¶ If you try to open many sublayers, you can now open them all within a same group in the legend.\nThis feature was funded by Kartoza\nThis feature was developed by Etienne Trimaille\n3D Features ¶ Feature: 3D map view and terrain generation ¶ We have a brand new native 3D map view in QGIS! The 3D map view displays 2D map (rendered from project layers) on top terrain. By default the terrain is a flat plane, but it is possible to use raster layers with digital elevation model as the source of height data.\nUse menu View \u0026gt; New 3D Map View to add a 3D view of the project. This will create a new dock widget with 3D map canvas. The 3D view uses the same controls like 2D map views to browse the map using mouse (drag map to move it around, mouse wheel to zoom) or keyboard arrow keys. In addition there are camera controls specific to 3D views: it is possible to rotate and tilt camera by one of the following ways:\nby dragging the mouse with middle mouse button pressed by pressing Shift and dragging the mouse with left mouse button pressed by pressing Shift and using up/down/left/right keys This feature was funded by QGIS.ORG\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: 3D renderers for map layers ¶ In the default configuration, map layers are rendered into 2D map images on top of the terrain. It is however possible to make better use of the 3D world by configuring 3D renderers for some map layers. With 3D renderers, the data can be displayed in 3D views as true 3D objects - this is currently supported for vector layers (all geometry types - point, line or polygon). This enables much better visualization, for example:\npolygons with building footprints may be extruded (possibly with data-defined height) to achieve 3D look points with tree point locations can be rendered with 3D symbols of trees (simple geometric shapes or existing 3D models loaded from a supported file format) To configure 3D renderers, use layer styling dock widget or the vector layer properties dialog - there is a new tab for configuration of 3D renderers.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.ORG\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias, Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nExpressions ¶ Feature: New expression variables ¶ Adds @project_crs and @project_crs_definition variables for retrieving the current project CRS\nFeature: new global expression variable @qgis_locale ¶ Returns current locale used by QGIS. By default this is current system locale. If user enabled locale override in QGIS settings overriden locale will be returned.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: New expression variables for map settings ¶ - map_crs, map_crs_definition: retrieves crs details for map - map_units: retrieves units for map (eg 'meters','degrees') This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New expression functions ¶ Atlas expressions\natlas_layerid and atlas_layername: Returns layer ID and layer name of the current layer in the atlas. Aggregate expressions\narray_agg(expression, group_by, filter): Returns an array of aggregated values from a field or expression. Array expressions\nNew group that contains expression functions for the creation and manipulation of arrays (also known as list data structures). The order of values within the array matters, in contrary to the 'map' data structure, where the order of key-value pairs is irrelevant and values are identified by their keys.\narray(value1, value2, \u0026hellip;) : Returns an array containing all the values passed as parameter. array_append(array, value): Returns an array with the given value added at the end. array_cat(array1, array2, \u0026hellip;): Returns an array containing all the given arrays concatenated. array_contains(array, value): Returns true if an array contains the given value. array_distinct(array): Returns an array containing distinct values of the given array. array_find(array, value): Returns the index (0 for the first one) of a value within an array. Returns -1 if the value is not found. array_first(array): Returns the first value of an array. array_get(array, index): Returns the Nth value (0 for the first one) of an array. array_insert(array, pos, value): Returns an array with the given value added at the given position. array_intersect(array1, array2): Returns true if any element of array1 exists in array2. array_last(array): Returns the last value of an array. array_length(array): Returns the number of elements of an array. array_prepend(array, value): Returns an array with the given value added at the beginning. array_remove_all(array, value): Returns an array with all the entries of the given value removed. array_remove_at(array, pos): Returns an array with the given index removed. array_reverse(array): Returns the given array with array values in reversed order. array_slice(array, start_pos, end_pos): Returns a portion of the array. The slice is defined by the start_pos and end_pos arguments. array_to_string(array, delimiter, empty_value): Concatenates array elements into a string separated by a delimiter using and optional string for empty values. regexp_matches(string, regex, empty_value): Returns an array of all strings captured by capturing groups, in the order the groups themselves appear in the supplied regular expression against a string. string_to_array(string, delimiter, empty_value): Splits string into an array using supplied delimiter and optional string for empty values. Color expressions\ncreate_ramp(map, discrete): Returns a gradient ramp from a map of color strings and steps. Date and Time expressions\nepoch(date): Return the interval in milliseconds between the unix epoch and a given date value. General expressions\nenv(name): Gets an environment variable and returns its content as a string. If the variable is not found, NULL will be returned. raster_statistic(layer, band, property): Returns statistics from a raster layer. Properties: min/max/avg/range/stdev/sum with_variable(name, value, node): This function sets a variable for any expression code that will be provided as 3rd argument. This is only useful for complicated expressions, where the same calculated value needs to be used in different places. Geometry expressions\nextend(geometry, start_distance, end_distance): Extends linestrings by a specified amount at the start and end of the line hausdorff_distance(geometry a, geometry b, densify_fraction): Returns the Hausdorff distance between two geometries. This is basically a measure of how similar or dissimilar 2 geometries are, with a lower distance indicating more similar geometries. inclination(inclination(point_a, point_b): Returns the inclination measured from the zenith (0) to the nadir (180) on point_a to point_b. make_circle(center, radius, segment): Creates a circular, segmentized, polygon. make_ellipse(center, semi_major_axis, semi_minor_axis, azimuth, segment): Creates an elliptical, segmentized, polygon. make_regular_polygon(center, radius, number_sides, circle): Creates a regular polygon. make_triangle(): help still missing minimal_circle(geometry, segment): Returns the minimal enclosing circle of a geometry. It represents the minimum circle that encloses all geometries within the set. offset_curve(geometry, distance, segments, join, miter_limit): Returns a geometry formed by offsetting a linestring geometry to the side. Distances are in the Spatial Reference System of this geometry. oriented_bbox(geom): Returns a geometry which represents the minimal oriented bounding box of an input geometry. pole_of_inaccessibility(geometry, tolerance): Calculates the approximate pole of inaccessibility for a surface, which is the most distant internal point from the boundary of the surface. This function uses the 'polylabel' algorithm (Vladimir Agafonkin, 2016), which is an iterative approach guaranteed to find the true pole of inaccessibility within a specified tolerance. simplify(geometry, tolerance): Simplifies a geometry by removing nodes using a distance based threshold (ie, the Douglas Peucker algorithm). The algorithm preserves large deviations in geometries and reduces the number of vertices in nearly straight segments. simplify_vw(geometry, tolerance): Simplifies a geometry by removing nodes using an area based threshold (the Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm). The algorithm removes vertices which create small areas in geometries, e.g., narrow spikes or nearly straight segments. smooth(geometry, iterations, offset, min_length, max_angle): Smooths a geometry by adding extra nodes which round off corners in the geometry. single_sided_buffer(geometry, distance, segments, join, miter_limit): Returns a geometry formed by buffering out just one side of a linestring geometry. Distances are in the Spatial Reference System of this geometry. Layer Property\ncrs_description returns the CRS description of the layer. Map Expressions\nThis group contains expression functions for the creation and manipulation of 'map' data structures (also known as dictionary objects, key-value pairs, or associative arrays). One can assign values to given keys. The order of the key-value pairs in the map object is not relevant.\nmap(key1, value1, key2, value2, , \u0026hellip;): Returns a map containing all the keys and values passed as pair of parameters. map_akeys(map): Returns all the keys of a map as an array. map_avals(map): Returns all the values of a map as an array. map_concat(map1, map2, \u0026hellip;): Returns a map containing all the entries of the given maps. If two maps contain the same key, the value of the second map is taken. map_delete(map, key): Returns a map with the given key and its corresponding value deleted. map_exist(map, key): Returns true if the given key exists in the map. map_get(map, key): Returns the value of a map, given it's key. map_insert(map, key, value): Returns a map with an added key/value. Map Layers\nNew group that contains a list of map layers available in the current project. Returns internal map layer ids. This is used in many other expression functions that reference map layers.\nMath expressions\ninclination(point_a, point_b): Returns the inclination measured from the zenith (0) to the nadir (180) on point_a to point_b. Operators\n~: Performs a regular expression match on a string value. Record and Attributes Expressions\nrenamed from just \u0026quot;Record\u0026quot;\nget_feature_by_id(layer, feature_id): Returns the feature with an id on a layer. is_selected(feature, layer): Returns if a feature is selected. If called with no parameters checks the current feature. num_selected(layer): Returns the number of selected features on a given layer. By default works on the layer on which the expression is evaluated. represent_value(value, fieldName): Returns the configured representafftion value for a field value. It depends on the configured widget type. Often, this is useful for 'Value Map' widgets. uuid(): Generates a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for each row using the Qt QUuid::createUuid method. Each UUID is 38 characters long. Relations\nNew group listing all available table relations in a project. Useful for relation_aggregate functions.\nDeprecated\n$scale: old variable to get current map scale. Replaced by maps_scale Changes\nChange in substr() function support negative start value (e.g. substr('hello',-2) returns 'lo') support negative length value (e.g. substr('hello',3,-1) returns 'll') length parameter now optional, defaults to end of string (e.g. substr('hello world',7) returns 'world') strpos() now relies on a simple string within a string search regexp_match() now returns pos of a matching regular expression This feature was developed by numerous developers\nFeature: Expose @parent variable in aggregate functions ¶ This makes it possible to access attributes and geometry from the parent feature when in the filter of the \u0026quot;aggregate\u0026quot; expression function. With this in place aggregates can be calculated per feature.\nE.g. max \u0026quot;measurement\u0026quot; for each point_station per polygon_research_area. Or a default attribute value when digitizing features:\naggregate(layer:='countries', aggregate:='max', expression:=\\\u0026quot;code\\\u0026quot;, filter:=intersects( $geometry, geometry(@parent) ) )\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Item_variables expression function inside compositions ¶ This adds a new item_variables expression function when expressions are used inside a composition context.\nThe function takes a single argument, the id for an item inside the composition, and returns a map of variable name to value for that item. This allows you to do things like insert text in a label fetching properties of another item in the composition, eg\nInsert scale of map into a label:\nmap_get( item_variables( 'map'),'map_scale')\nInsert x coordinate of map center into a label:\nx(map_get( item_variables( 'map'),'map_extent_center'))\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nDocumentation ¶ Feature: Processing algorithms enhancements ¶ Processing algorithms have been reviewed and documented. Clicking the Help button will open the QGIS website and show the algorithm description with enhanced documentation and pictures.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Grant Proposal\nThis feature was developed by Matteo Ghetta (Faunalia), Alexander Bruy\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Data defined symbol layer visibility ¶ Adds a data defined override to control a symbol layer's visibility. Allows users to disable drawing certain symbol layers for matching features.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: save and restore color ramp used for singleband pseudocolor rendering ¶ This feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Add Points and Inches to available symbol units ¶ This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New color ramp button widget ¶ In QGIS 3.0, handling of color ramps has gotten much better via a newly introduced color ramp button widget. Improvements include: - custom color ramp settings are remembered when projects are re-opened - color ramp inversion is implemented within the widget, enabling this action across QGIS - quick access to \u0026quot;favorite\u0026quot; color ramps within the widget pop-up menu - interfacing with catalogs (cpt-city and ColorBrewer) is now much more pleasant\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Style management re-work and upgrade ¶ Style management has received a major upgrade. The improvements include:\nA new favorite grouping system was added, which the symbols list widget defaults to The selected tag / smartgroup in the symbols list widget now persists when switching layers (and across sessions) The symbols list widget will update the tag / smartgroup combo box when users add / rename / remove categories Users can now directly tag, as well as add to favorites, symbols while saving those to the style database To streamline style management, groups have been removed and fully replaced by tags Tags have been integrated into the import/export user interface This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Support setting of color and transparency on multiple items for raster renderers ¶ It is now possible to change the color and transparency for multiple values at the same time for the singleband pseudocolor and the paletted renderers. Simply select values within the values' list and right click to have a pop-up menu appear.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Show an alpha slider in color button drop down menu ¶ Allows quick tweaks to the color alpha\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Raster stretch toolbar actions support for pseudocolor renderer ¶ This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Transparency support for paletted renderer ¶ In QGIS 3.0, it is now possible to change the transparency value for unique values for the paletted renderer.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: raster auto-stretching when updating canvas ¶ see https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2016-September/044393.html follow up to raster pseudocolor updated extent auto classification.\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nFeature: Control over annotation contents margins ¶ Allows setting left/top/right/bottom margins for the contents within an annotation.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Annotations can be styled using fill symbol styles ¶ This changes the rendering of annotation frames to use QGIS' symbology engine, which means that all the existing fill styles can now be used to style annotation frames.\nAlso paint effects \u0026amp; data defined symbol parameters.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Point cluster renderer ¶ New symbol renderer that groups nearby points into a single rendered marker symbol. Optionally, a label displays the number of features that have been aggregated into the single symbol.\nAdditionally, some improvements have been made to the point displacement renderer, specifically:\npoints are now assigned to the group which is \u0026quot;nearest\u0026quot; them, rather then just assigning them first group within the search distance. In some cases this was assigning features to a more distant cluster, resulting in less predictable cluster patterns individual points are now correctly shown in their own selection state lots of code cleanup + documentation too. For developers: QgsPointDisplacementRenderer has been split into a new pure virtual QgsPointDistanceRenderer base class which handles the detection of clusters and grouping of points. The new cluster renderer reuses this base class to avoid code duplication.\nSee the crowd funding programme for more details.\nThis feature was funded by Andreas Neumann, Qtibia Engineering (Tudor Barascu), Karl-Magnus Jönsson, Geonesia (Nicolas Ponzo) \u0026amp; numerous additional anonymous backers whose generous contributions are also highly valued!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: NEW MAP COLORING ALGORITHMS IN QGIS 3.0 ¶ see http://nyalldawson.net/2017/02/new-map-coloring-algorithms-in-qgis-3-0/\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New \u0026quot;preset\u0026quot; colors color ramp option ¶ Allows use of a color ramp consisting of a list of selected colors. Currently there's no way in QGIS to classify a renderer using some list of colors you've previously selected. So you can modify the colors manually after classifying, but that's a pain if you're regularly using the same color scheme. Basically, it's like the color brewer color ramp options but allowing users to pick their own preset list of colors to use (Because Cynthia Brewer isn't the only cartographic color expert!)\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Allow symbol layers to be temporarily disabled ¶ Adds a new checkbox at the bottom of each symbol layer's properties which allows you to control whether the layer is enabled or not. Disabled layers are not drawn, but are saved and can be enabled at a later stage. This makes it easier to tweak symbol appearance without having to totally delete a symbol layer.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Easy styling of discrete rasters ¶ In QGIS 3.0, the existing raster Paletted Renderer for rasters was adapted to allow for easy styling of discrete raster layers, such as landcover or boolean rasters. Now, users can select the renamed \u0026quot;Paletted/Unique Values\u0026quot; renderer and click the \u0026quot;Add Unique Values\u0026quot; button to load all unique raster values from the layer. These are automatically assigned a color using the selected color ramp.\nThe unique value calculation is performed in a background thread to keep the UI responsive for large (or remote) raster layers. Additionally, users can manually add individual new classes as desired, and edit the associated pixel value for any existing class. Deleting multiple classes at once is also supported, as well as changing the color, transparency and labels for multiple classes at once.\nColor palettes can be loaded from a text file, with ESRI clr/GDAL/GRASS color table formats supported. Color palettes can be saved to a clr text file for sharing.\nThis feature was funded by Stéphane Henriod, Satelligence (http://satelligence.com/), Bird's Eye View (https://www.birdseyeviewgis.com/), other anonymous backers\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Allow label font size in mm/pixels ¶ This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Custom labelling toolbar is now always enabled ¶ Thanks to the awesome auxiliary data storage and the editable joined table, the manual label customization is now always enabled. You do not need anymore to add dedicated fields in your datasource to change labels position, rotation, or any of the possible settings for labels to activate the toolbar. No more copy of readonly datasources and so much faster labeling ! Be warned, labels are only saved along with your project file in a .qgd sqlite database, or inside the .qgz zipped project file if you chose that format. Don't forget to share that .qgd file if you want to share your project file.\nAnd for power users, the old way of having data defined fields in your datasource is still there. Just define them in the layer's properties as before!\nThis feature was funded by French ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Developpement\nThis feature was developed by OSLANDIA - Paul Blottiere\nDiagrams ¶ Feature: Data definable properties ¶ Add support for more data definable properties to diagrams:\nDistance Priority ZIndex IsObstacle Show AlwaysShow Diagram Start Angle This feature was funded by QGIS Grant Program\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nRendering ¶ Feature: Live layer support ¶ QGIS 3.0 now supports live layers. These layers get re-rendered automatically at a time interval that you determine, in a clean and flicker free way. Live layers are great for tracking continuously changing data like a fleet of cars, a flock of birds that you have telemetry data for and so on.\nThis feature was developed by Kartoza \u0026amp; North Road\nFeature: Trigger layer refresh or layer actions from PostgreSQL NOTIFY signal ¶ Following the live layer effects, this allows to trigger actions or layer refresh in QGIS only when the database notifies QGIS it should do something. It will require less ressources than refreshing on interval, and you can even code a chat application in QGIS with that :)\nSee https://vimeo.com/236604742\nhttp://oslandia.com/en/2017/10/07/refresh-your-maps-from-postgresql/\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.org Grant application\nThis feature was developed by OSLANDIA - Vincent Mora\nFeature: Cache labeling result to avoid unnecessary redraws when refreshing canvas ¶ This change allows the labeling results to be cached to an image following a map render. If the cached label result image can be reused for the next render then it will be, avoiding the need to redraw all layers participating in the labeling problem and resolving the labeling solution. Basically this means that canvas refreshes as a result of changes to any NON-LABELED layer are much faster. (Changing a layer which is part of the labeling solution still requires all labeled layers to be completely redrawn)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Grid renderer for points displacement ¶ Grid renderer for points displacement\nThis feature was developed by Muhammad Yarjuna Rohmat (Kartoza)\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Range vertex selection in node tool ¶ That feature makes it possible to select a range of vertices from one feature.\nIt can be activated by pressing Shift+R - afterwards one needs to click start and final point within a feature - this will selected all vertices between the two.\nThe range selection can be cancelled anytime by right-click or by pressing Esc key.\nFor closed curves (polygons), it is possible to switch to the \u0026quot;longer\u0026quot; way around the ring by holding Ctrl while clicking the final point.\nThis feature was funded by French ministry in charge of ecology\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Add default Z value option ¶ Create Geopackages/Shapefiles: Now with the option to have Z-values\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Lisovenko / Paul Blottiere\nFeature: Move feature now benefits from Advanced Digitizing ¶ Just move a feature using the new \u0026quot;click - click ergonomy\u0026quot; and use the advanced digitizing panel and shortcut to constraint angles, distances, exact XY.\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Added functionality to copy/move feature to move feature map tool ¶ This allow to duplicate feature and move them in one move from a selected feature\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Tracing with offset ¶ You can now use the trace digitising tool with an offset as shown in the accompanying image.\nThis feature was funded by d.b.g. Datenbankgesellschaft mbH\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias\nFeature: Overhaul of the Vertex tool ¶ The Node tool (now renamed to Vertex tool) has undergone a complete rework to make it more flexible. Some of the more important changes are:\nInstead of requiring users to first select a feature and then edit its vertices in the second step, the tool now capable of working with multiple features at the same time. It is therefore easy to select vertices from several features and move or delete them at once. If there is a need to constrain selection of vertices to just specific feature(s), it is possible to select the features with selection tool first - the vertex tool will only work with vertices from selected feature(s) in such cases. Instead of working just with the currently selected layer, the tool is now able to work with all layers that are in editing mode at the same time. Moving of features that logically belong together but are located in different layers has got much easier. Still, the current layer is respected if there are multiple choices when picking vertices. Features and their vertices get highlighted as the user moves the mouse pointer over them, giving better visual feedback. In QGIS 2.x the vertices would be moved by clicking a vertex, dragging it with the left mouse button still pressed and finally dropping them by releasing the mouse button. This behavior has been changed to \u0026quot;click-click\u0026quot; approach where user first clicks a vertex to pick it, then drag it without having any mouse buttons pressed and drop it by clicking again on the final destination. The arguments for this change were the following: it is easier to precisely place nodes (not having to apply force to the mouse button all the time) one does not move nodes inadvertently it is possible to cancel the operation it allows to pan the map by pressing space bar while the node is being moved See https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/69 for more information.\nThis feature was funded by QWAT\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Vertex tool: mid-point markers to add vertices ¶ The improved vertex tool now also displays extra markers on the mid-point of line segments of features. Clicking such marker results in addition of a new vertex. The existing way of adding vertices by double-clicking segments has been kept.\nThis feature was funded by QWAT\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Vertex tool: continue line ¶ When editing linestring geometries with the vertex tool, moving the mouse towards the first or the last vertex will display an extra marker just next to the endpoint. Clicking the marker will add a vertex at the end of the geometry.\nThis feature was funded by QWAT\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Vertex tool: support for advanced digitizing panel ¶ The advanced digitizing panel now works also with the vertex tool - it is possible to enter coordinates of new or existing vertices in the panel just like in other digitizing map tools.\nThis feature was funded by QWAT\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nData Management ¶ Feature: Pan to current feature in attribute table ¶ This feature was developed by Marco Hugentobler\nFeature: Map of CRS-extent in Project properties ¶ Feature: Auxiliary Storage Support ¶ A new tab is available in vector layer properties to manage auxiliary storage :\nA new action Store data in the project is available in the data defined menu providing an easy way to manage auxiliary data for a property :\nAuxiliary data is stored in a sqlite database and managed thanks to the OGR data provider (instead of the spatialite provider) to keep as small as possible the database file. This database file (with extension .qgd) is either saved just next to the project file or directly embedded within the new .qgz format.\nSee the original pull request and this article which explains more\nThis feature was developed by Paul Blottiere / Oslandia\nFeature: Metadata overhaul ¶ The metadata system in QGIS has been overhauled. In QGIS 3.0 we introduce our own internal, formalised metadata schema which is separate from the QGIS project file format. We introduce new API capabilities for reading and writing metadata for layers. We have separated the display of metatadata from the editing and have added a new metadata editing tool. Metadata are currently saved in the project file. It can also be saved as an XML file alongside file based layers or in a local sqlite database for remote layers (e.g. PostGIS).\nyou can read more about the design considerations adopted in this work by referring to the QGIS Enhancement Proposal (QEP) - QEP-92\nPlease note this is the first phase in the development of a complete and standards compliant metadata infrastructure for QGIS. We are seeking further funding to implement a more complete implementation for the metadata system - see this document for details of future planned work packages that need funding.\nThe specification for the QGIS metadata schema is here.\nThe primary funder for this work was The WorldBank/GFDRR with supporting funding provided by NINA.\nThis feature was funded by WorldBank/GFDRR\nThis feature was developed by Kartoza and collaborators\nFeature: Unified data source manager dialog ¶ A single unified dialog to handle data source management and layers loading.\nThis feature was funded by Boundless\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: OSM Downloader tool removed ¶ We have removed the OSM downloader tool that was provided in 2.x releases of QGIS. We encourage you to rather use the QuickOSM plugin which has been ported to QGIS 3.0.\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Allow controlling labels for individual edit widgets ¶ In the drag and drop designer, a double click on an item will allow controlling if the label should be shown for each item individually.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Allow configuring link/unlink feature buttons on relation editor widget ¶ This feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: conditional visibility for tabs and groupboxes ¶ This adds a new configuration option to conditionally show or hide tabs and groupboxes in drag and drop designer forms. Configuration is done via a double click in the designer tree in the fields configuration interface. An expression can be entered to control the visibility. The expression will be re-evaluated everytime values in the form change and the tab or groupbox shown/hidden accordingly.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Smarter default edit widgets with plugins to pick them ¶ Now the widgets can give a score on how well they could handle the type of a field. Leading to better default widgets.\nAdditionally, plugins can be added to choose a widget type in function of external information. One of them uses a table in PostgreSQL, allowing to specify the widget type and configuration to use for each field.\nAutomatically pick RelationReference widgets for foreign keys.\nThis feature was developed by Patrick Valsecchi\nFeature: Field constraints can be enforced or not ¶ Non-enforced constraints just show a warning to the user, but do not prevent committing the feature. Enforced constraints block users from committing non compliant features. So we have soft warnings now! Any constraints detected by the provider are always enforced.\nThis feature was funded by OpenGIS.ch\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add layer scoped actions ¶ Within the attribute table, there is a new button to trigger actions which are not based on individual features but instead on the whole layer. Normally they will perform actions based on all features or the selection.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Show field values in autocompleter in form filter mode ¶ The autocompleter is nicely updated in the background so that the gui remains nice and responsive, even if there's millions of records in the associated table.\nIt's now used as a search widget for text fields, so can be seen in the browser window if you set the filter to a text field, or if you launch the form based select/filter by selecting a layer and pressing F3.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add zoom to features and flash features shortcuts in select by form dialog ¶ Allows very quick navigation and identification of features which match the criteria in the form\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add between/not between to numerical fields in select by form ¶ This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: Hide Deselected Layers action ¶ Allows you to quickly hide all deselected layers. This is very handy when you have a large project and want to quickly hide all except for a couple of layers\nThis feature was funded by SMEC (Surbana Jurong)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Change of ergonomy of the visibility of layers inside groups ¶ Checking/unchecking a group doesn't change the check state of its children. A node is visible if and only if it is checked and all its parents too. There is no more a semi-checked state for a group Ctrl-clic on a unchecked group will check the group and all its descendants. Clic on a unchecked layer will check the lager and all its parents. Ctrl-clic on a checked group will uncheck the group and all its descendants. Ctrl-clic on a checked layer will uncheck the layer and all its parents. Those actions are available in contextual menu items in the tree view. Invisible layers because they or their parent(s) is unchecked are greyed out. This feature was developed by Even Rouault\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: Control over drawing of composer table grid horizontal \u0026amp; vertical lines ¶ It is now possible to independently control horizontal and vertical line rendering of composer table items. This added flexibility expends the styling possibilities of this item directly within QGIS.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Drag qpt to QGIS to create new composer from template ¶ This feature was funded by SMEC (Surbana Jurong)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Allow customization of line spacing for composer legend item labels ¶ This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Allow choice of CRS for map items ¶ This allows the CRS for map items to differ from the canvas/project CRS. It also allows different map items to have different CRS, eg an overview map can be set to a different CRS to the main map.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Holding shift while drawing polyline/polygon constrains line angles ¶ This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: More data definable controls ¶ Item frame and background colors Data defined svg colors and outline width for composer picture items (Especially useful when the picture is showing a north arrow!) Data defined legend titles and column count Data defined scalebar colors and line width\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Grant Program\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Map Composer Overhaul ¶ This is a major rework to how compositions are managed in the code of QGIS.\nHighlights are:\nA new QgsLayoutManager class which is used for storage and serializing/deserializing of compositions. A QgsLayoutManager is attached to QgsProject. This allows core code to access the compositions attached to a project. All handling of compositions has been moved from app to core, making it easy for server (and other non-app based projects. QField/roam?) to access project compositions without resorting to fragile xml parsing. Composer windows are created on demand and destroyed on close. This avoids the heavy requirement of creating all composer windows and widgets for every single composer item when loading projects. It was the main reason loading projects with compositions were so slow previously. Now, composer windows are created only when the window is opened and destroyed when the window is closed. Composer item configuration widgets are also only created on demand (when an item is selected) instead of precreating all widgets. A side benefit of destroying composer windows on close is that we now no longer suffer from a Qt bug which blocked use of floating docks in composer windows. Now you can float the item/composition/etc panels! Much nicer for full screen working with compositions on multi-monitor setups. Reworked API for working with composers through iface. Since composer windows don't exist unless they are currently open, all the iface methods for interacting with composers have been redone to make it clear that they only apply to open windows. Additionally, a simple composer interface which provides a stable API for plugins and scripts to work with composer windows has been added. Very basic for now, but in future we can extend with more hooks to allow plugins to interact with composer windows. Lots of code cleanups and removal More info at https://north-road.com/qgis-layout-and-reporting-engine-campaign/\nThis feature was funded by The Swiss QGIS User Group and many more!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: Raster unique values count for processing ¶ http://imhere-asia.com/blog/post/qgis-raster-layer-unique-values-count\nThis feature was developed by http://imhere-asia.com/\nProcessing ¶ Feature: New algorithm for offsetting lines ¶ This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New algorithm for single sided buffers ¶ This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add choice of simplification method to simplify ¶ This change allows users to choose which method to use when running the simplify geometries algorithm, with choices of the existing distance based (Douglas Peucker) algorithm, area based (Visvalingam) algorithm and snap-to-grid.\nVisvaligam in particular usually results in more cartographically pleasing simplification over the standard distance based methods.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: support for output geometry types in models ¶ Model child algorithm inputs are now filtered to only those which generate applicable geometry types for the input to another child algorithm\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Angle threshold for smooth algorithm ¶ Add option to QgsGeometry::smooth to not smooth segments shorter than a certain threshold or sharp corners with an angle exceeding a threshold\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Better support for Z/M dimensions and curved geometries ¶ Many more algorithms now respect Z/M values and do not discard this information, and additionally many algorithms now correctly maintain curved geometries without forced segmentization of these geometries.\nFeature: Raster analysis algorithms added to Processing ¶ The following algorithms were added to Processing from the Raster Analysis plugin:\nAspect Slope Ruggedness Hillshade Relief Now these algorithms can be used in scripts, models and for batch processing.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: New algorithm to extract specific nodes ¶ This algorithm allows you to extract specific nodes from geometries. Eg you can extract the first or last node in the geometry.\nThe algorithm accepts a comma separated list of node indices to extract, eg 0 = first node, 1 = second node, etc. Negative indices can be used to extract nodes from the end of the geometry. Eg -1 = last node, -2 = second last node.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Expose zonal statistics from Zonal statistics plugin in toolbox ¶ This feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Add a spatialite execute SQL algorithm ¶ This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: New algorithm to extend lines ¶ Allows extending linestrings by a set distance at the start and end of the line\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New extract by expression algorithm ¶ Filters an input layer by expression\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add import into spatialite algorithm ¶ This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Interpolation algorithms ¶ Expose IDW and TIN interpolation from Interpolation plugin in toolbox\nInterpolation plugin has been removed as a result\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: New algorithm to compute geometry by expression ¶ This algorithm updates existing geometries (or creates new geometries) for input features by use of a QGIS expression. This allows complex geometry modifications which can utilise all the flexibility of the QGIS expression engine to manipulate and create geometries for output features.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Snap geometries to layer algorithm ¶ Port the Geometry Snapper plugin to processing\nSnap geometries algorithm allows snapping to other layer types, supports point/line layers\nSnap to layer algorithm accepts a mode parameter. With a new option to prefer to snap to closest point on geometry. The old behaviour was to prefer to snap to nodes, even if a node was further from the input geometry than a segment. The new option allows you to snap geometries to the closest point, regardless of whether it's a node or segment.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New input type for expressions ¶ This adds a new input type for expression inputs. Expression inputs can be linked to a parent layer so that the builder shows the correct fields and layer variables.\nIt's designed to be used when an algorithm specifically requires an expression, eg Select by Expression and Extract by Expression.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: SplitWithLines ¶ Rename algorithm SplitLinesWithLines to SplitWithLines Accept polygon as input, too Use only selected lines to split with (if processing is set to use selection only) Issue log message if trying to split multi geometries Update help\nThis feature was developed by Bernhard Ströbl\nFeature: Pole of inaccessibility algorithm ¶ Implements a processing algorithm to calculate the pole of inaccessibility for a surface, which is the most distant internal point from the boundary of the surface. This function uses the 'polylabel' algorithm (Vladimir Agafonkin, 2016), which is an iterative approach guaranteed to find the true pole of inaccessibility within a specified tolerance. More precise tolerances require more iterations and will take longer to calculate.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Extract by attribute can extract for null/notnull values ¶ Adds support for filtering where an attribute value is null or not null\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Create attribute index algorithm ¶ Allows creation of an index on an attribute in a layer for faster attribute based filtering\nSupport depends on the underlying data provider for the layer\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New 'drop geometries' algorithm ¶ Simply removes any geometries from an input layer and returns the features with attributes only\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New universal 'basic stats for field' algorithm ¶ Replaces the existing 'Basic Stats for Numeric Fields' and 'Basic Stats for String Fields' algorithms and adds support for date/time/datetime fields.\nHaving a single unified algorithm allows more flexible models where a field type may not be known in advance.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Port heatmap plugin to processing algorithm ¶ This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New algorithm to orthagonalize geometries ¶ Adds a new algorithm which tries to make angles in geometries either right angles or straight lines\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Network analysis algorithms ¶ add shortest path and service area algorithms to Processing\nalso allow calculating shortest path from a point to all points in a layer, or from all points in a layer to an end point. And creating service areas for all points in a layer.\nRoadgraph plugin has been removed as a result.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Export processing models as PDF/SVG ¶ In addition to exporting processing models as bitmap images, it is now possible to export processing models as resolution-independent PDFs and SVGs. This allows for high-resolution export of models which can be embedded into papers and books being published.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: New algorithm to truncate tables ¶ Irretrievably deletes all features from a table... use with caution!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Added \u0026lsquo;invalid feature handling\u0026rsquo; option ¶ This feature was developed by Victor Olaya\nFeature: Algorithm to fix invalid geometries using native makeValid() implementation ¶ This feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Add search to Get Scripts and Models dialog ¶ This feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Generic centroid algorithm ¶ Reworked centroid algorithm which handles non-polygon layers\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved Extract nodes algorithm ¶ Extract nodes algorithm now saves node index, distance along line and angle at node\nThis feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New algorithm for translating (moving) points ¶ Allows geometries to be shifted by a x/y displacement\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved processing modeler window ¶ The processing modeler window has received a lot of attention for this release.

Query a remote API to get a geojson\nThis feature was developed by Etienne Trimaille\nFeature: Optimised points along geometry algorithm ¶ Supports also polygon geometries, handles null geometries, and records the original line angle along with the distance for each point.\nThis feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Sort by expression algorithm ¶ This feature was funded by DFAT/DMI\nThis feature was developed by Etienne Trimaille (Kartoza)\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: New zipped project file format .qgz ¶ A long time ago on the developper's mailing list, we discussed of a container storing the xml file and other ressources. This is now possible, though it remains optional. The auxiliary storage feature takes advantage of that by storing the associated .qgd sqlite database. We hope that in next versions land support for embedding other resources like SVG, color ramps, datasources, images, etc...\nThis feature was funded by French ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Developpement\nThis feature was developed by OSLANDIA - Paul Blottiere\nFeature: Add support for user profiles ¶ All user settings/plugins, etc are now loaded from the app data location for each platform and no longer .qgis3/2. Settings and plugins in each profile are now isolated from each other.\nThis allows for different runtime setups depending on what the user needs, e.g test, prod, demo, etc\nProfile menu allows for switching between profiles or creating new ones.\nThis feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Drag'n'drop layers from layer tree view to browser dock ¶ Makes it easy to e.g. store your temporary layers in PostGIS\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias\nFeature: Standalone QGIS Browser application removed ¶ We have removed the standalone QGIS Browser application that shipped with QGIS 2.x. This application had poor user uptake and represented a maintenance overhead that we do not wish to continue with in the 3.0 code base.\nData Providers ¶ Feature: New unified 'add layer' dialog ¶ You can now use a single dialog to add a huge variety of data formats to QGIS.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: GeoPackage ¶ processing uses pkg by default save as uses pkg by default create new layer uses pkg by default browser drag and drop import layers This feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Support all GDAL writable raster formats for 'Save as' dialog on raster layers ¶ This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Support for Z/M geometries in gpkg, spatialite and memory layer provider ¶ Support for Z dimension and M values was added to QGIS' gpkg, spatialite and memory layer provider. the option to add Z and M dimensions has also been added to the \u0026quot;create new layer\u0026quot; dialogs\nThis feature was funded by QWAT group, http://www.imhere-asia.com/\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin, Alexander Bury, Paul Blottiere\nFeature: Unique and not-null constraint handling ¶ Automatic detection of provider-side unique and not-null constraints implemented for postgres, spatialite, ogr provider\nClient side unique and not-null constraints can be set within QGIS.\nUnique constraints are enforced in attribute form\nThis feature was funded by OpenGIS.ch\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: GeoNode integration ¶ GeoNode is an open source geospatial content management system that makes it easy to publish geospatial data on the web. QGIS 3.0 includes new functionality that will allow you to very easily add a GeoNode instance to the browser tree and add any layers from that site to your project as WMS, WFS or XYZ. There is no need to dig around trying to figure out WMS/WFS end points, QGIS will do everything for you. When using WMS and XYZ Tiled layers, the style of the published GeoNode layer will be used.\nIf the GeoNode instance uses the QGIS Server backend rather than a GeoServer backed, you can copy and paste styles from the server and apply them to your local layer so that your WFS layer renders exactly as it does on the server (as shown in the animated GIF here).\nThere are also python bindings so that you can add GeoServer layers to QGIS from your plugins. If you are interested in running your own GeoNode with QGIS Server backend please see this site for details on how you can do that using docker and rancher.\nThis feature was funded by WorldBank/GFDRR\nThis feature was developed by Kartoza\nFeature: Detect literal default values for spatialite provider ¶ This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Create attribute index support for spatialite provider ¶ Allows creation of attribute indexes for spatialite layers\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add support for arrays ¶ Supported by postgres, spatialite\nThis feature was developed by Patrick Valsecchi\nFeature: Support for HStore in PostGIS data provider ¶ Feature: Add auto-discovery of relations for PostgresQL ¶ This feature was developed by Patrick Valsecchi\nFeature: Data dependencies between layers ¶ This allows to declare data dependencies between layers. A data dependency occurs when a data modification in a layer, not by direct user manipulation may modify data of other layers. This is the case for instance when geometry of a layer is updated by a database trigger after modification of another layer's geometry.\nThis feature was developed by Hugo Mercier\nFeature: dxf export: support reprojection ¶ This feature was developed by Juergen E. Fischer\nFeature: Load/save style in database for GPKG and Spatialite ¶ This feature was developed by Even Rouault\nFeature: Improved handling of defaults ¶ Improve handling of defaults (inc provider default clauses, literal defaults, and QGIS expression defaults) and automatically handle unique value constraints on layers\nAny fields with unique value constraints will be guaranteed to have a value which is unique to the field.\nThis also means that after certain editing operations (e.g. copy-paste, split features etc.) attributes will now be set to their default value, if applicable.\nThis feature was funded by Canton of Zug and the QGEP project\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: QGIS Server overhaul ¶ As you may know, QGIS is jumping to a new major version (yes!). Doing so was made necessary because of the need to switch to python 3, QT5, but also because we needed to break the QGIS API in several places. (http://blog.qgis.org/2016/02/10/qgis-3-0-plans/)\nA year ago, a tiny troll from switzerland rang a bell about the strong need for love server code base required. Indeed, the API was locked by some old methods of QGIS server. In short, QGIS server was reparsing the qgs project file in his own way, and created dependencies to part of QGIS we needed to drop.\nAs outsourcing the server code base was not an option, so we had to refactor it. The involved parties decided to get engaged in a code sprint in the city of Lyon, France dedicated to sharing their vision, planning the work and finally making all the following happen:\nHigher level refactoring\nAll services (WMS GetMap, WFS GetFeature, GetLegendGraphics, WCS, GetPrint etc..) have been rewritten. Some like WMS were entirely rewritten. Kudos to the devs!\nNew features\nMulti-thread rendering like in the desktop A new option to trust layer metadata and thus speed up project loading WFS 1.1 support https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5297 Full Python bindings for the server API Server Services as plugins like providers Deep, complex and unrewarding tasks\nRemove all singleton calls Cut all the dependencies to the old QGIS project file parser Minimize dependencies to GUI library. Since fonts are necessary to render maps, totally removing them was not feasable. Infrastructure tasks\nBuild a OGC compliancy platform and integrate it to a continuous integration platform. Conformity reports are now pushed to tests.qgis.org Add unit tests ... and again more unit tests Stress QGIS server against security leaks (SQL injections and other malicious attacks) Start profiling and bench marking performances. This work still need some love - and funding - to be achieved A presentation was given at FOSS4G-EU in July.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.ORG Donors\nFeature: Possibility to segmentize feature info geometry in server ¶ Many web clients can't display circular arcs in geometries. To allow such clients to still display a feature's geometry (e.g. for highlighting the feature), a new per project QGIS server option was introduced (Menu \u0026quot;Project\u0026quot; -\u0026gt; \u0026quot;Project Properties\u0026quot; -\u0026gt; \u0026quot;QGIS Server\u0026quot;) to segmentize the geometry before sending it to the client in a GetFeatureInfo response.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton of Zug\nThis feature was developed by Marco Hugentobler\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Remove trusted status from Plugin Manager ¶ https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5272\nFeature: Offline editing: Add flag to only copy selected features ¶ This extends the offline editing possibilities to only work on subset of large layers\nThis feature was funded by DB Fahrwegdienste GmbH\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: GDALTools moved to Processing ¶ GDALTools plugin has been removed.\nAll functions previously available through the GDALTools plugin were moved to the QGIS Processing framework, allowing to use these tools in scripts, models and execute them in batch processes. Additionaly we updated the algorithms with new parameters, introduced in latest GDAL versions and improved overall UI/UX by exposing some advanced parameters like creation options, NODATA value settings etc.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: allow installing plugins from local ZIP packages ¶ It is now more easy to install plugins manually without having to unzip them in the user profile directory by hand.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Plugins can provide a custom help in Expression window ¶ Plugins which are providing expressions can add a custom help made with HTML strings.\nThis feature was funded by DFAT/DMI\nThis feature was developed by Etienne Trimaille (Kartoza)\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Geometry class updates ¶ There has been a major overhaul of the geometry classes in QGIS. The old classes have been renamed (as per the table below). New geometry classes will properly preserve Z and M attributes if present.\nReferences https://github.com/qgis/qgis3.0\\_api/issues/11\nThis finally brings back a consistent state in naming within the geometry API\nRenames ¶ QGIS 2 QGIS 3 QgsPolygon QgsPolygonXY QgsMultiPoint QgsMultiPointXY QgsMultiPolyline QgsMultiPolylineXY QgsMultiPolygon QgsMultiPolygonXY QgsPolygonV2 QgsPolygon QgsMultiPointV2 QgsMultiPoint QgsMultiPolylineV2 QgsMultiPolyline QgsMultiPolygonV2 QgsMultiPolygon See also https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/5491\nThis feature was developed by Matthias, Nyall and others\nFeature: Task manager ¶ Introduces a framework for creating background tasks, which are interacted with through a centralised manager\nAdds new classes: - QgsTask. An interface for long-running background tasks - QgsTaskManager. Handles groups of tasks - also available as a QgsApplication member for tracking application wide tasks\nAdd simple python method QgsTask.fromFunction for creation of tasks from a function without having to create a QgsTask subclass\nSupport for dependent tasks\nCancelling a task on which others depend leads to all these other tasks getting cancelled as well.\nAdd handling of dependent layers to task manager\nIf a task has dependent layers which are about to be removed, the task will automatically be cancelled\nQgsTasks can have subtasks\nNow, a QgsTask can have subtask QgsTasks set by calling QgsTask::addSubTask. Sub tasks can have their own set of dependent tasks.\nSubtasks are not visible to users, and users only see the overall progress and status of the parent task.\nThis allows creation of tasks which are themselves built off many smaller component tasks. The task manager will still handle firing up and scheduling the subtasks, so eg subtasks can run in parallel (if their dependancies allow this).\nSubtasks can themselves have subtasks.\nThis change is designed to allow the processing concept of algorithms and modeller algorithms to be translatable directly to the task manager architecture.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Grant Program\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: API to allow drag'n'drop of custom browser items ¶ QgsDataItem implementations may provide hasDragEnabled(), mimeUri() and QgsCustomDropHandler implementation to deal with drop of custom items.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog30/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 3.0"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 3.10 ¶ Release date: 2019-10-25\nQGIS 3.10 brings an extensive list of new changes and a lot of polishing of existing features - the highlights of which we will try to cover here.

(This setting can be found in the rendering panel of the options dialog).\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Improved copy/paste of symbols ¶ We're passionate about making QGIS a user-friendly cartographic tool which is a joy to work with, so we've added a bunch of new shortcuts throughout the interface which allow you to copy and paste symbols from one part of QGIS to another. E.g, you can copy a symbol from a category and paste it directly onto another category, or a layout shape item, or inside the style manager dialog!\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: \u0026quot;Center of segment\u0026quot; placement mode for marker and hash line symbol layers ¶ We've added a brand new \u0026quot;Center of segment\u0026quot; mode for placement of marker line or hashed lines symbols. This allows you to place markers or hash lines over the center point of individual line segments, exposing cartographic effects which were not possible before (and improving the quality of layers converted from ArcMap using the SLYR tool).\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: More flexible data defined offset expressions ¶ In previous QGIS releases, only string values of the format 'x,y' would be permitted for data-defined symbol and label offsets. We've listened to user feedback that this was confusing, and in QGIS 3.10 we now allow arrays of numbers as a valid expression result for offsets. E.g. \u0026quot;array(3,5)\u0026quot;.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Create and manage text formats and label settings in QGIS styles ¶ In QGIS 3.10 we've finally implemented a long-awaited feature, allowing users to manage their own libraries of custom text formats and label settings alongside their existing symbol libraries!\nNow, the Style Manager dialog can be used to manage text formats (which store the font, color, buffers, shadows, and backgrounds of text formats) and layer-wide label settings. (A \u0026quot;text format\u0026quot; includes just font settings and other appearance related settings, while a \u0026quot;labe setting\u0026quot; also includes layer-type specific settings such as label placement, priority, and rendering settings).\nText Formats and Label Settings offer all the same functionality as you're used to for managing symbols and color ramps within styles, including import and export to XML files, tagging, smart groups, favoriting etc...\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by North Road\nFeature: Marker symbols as label backgrounds ¶ Alongside all the other exciting labeling improvements which we've landed in 3.10, we now allow use of marker symbols as a background for labels. This allows you to use all the rich functionality available for marker symbols as a background to labels, and complements the existing shapes and SVG background choices!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by North Road\nFeature: Label callouts! ¶ A common practice when placing labels on a crowded map is to use 'callouts' - labels which are placed outside (or displaced from) their associated feature, with a line connecting the label and the feature. In QGIS 3.10, we've added native support for quickly and easily creating beautiful label callouts (no more expression mangling or drawing by hand!).\nWe've added many settings for controlling exactly how these label callouts are drawn, and naturally, you can take full advantage of the richness of QGIS line symbol support within your callouts! This includes all the existing line symbol styles, layer effects, and even support for data-defined settings!\nIn 3.10, we expose options for either a \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot; (direct line) or \u0026quot;Manhattan\u0026quot; (straight lines) callout styles. If you're interested in sponsoring additional callout styles in a future release, get in contact with the QGIS team to find out how you can make this happen!\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Change multi-line label alignment for individual labels ¶ We've added an additional option to allow you to control multi-line alignment on a label-by-label basis. Just active the Label Properties tool and click on your map labels, and a new setting for the text alignment is now available.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Show unplaced labels ¶ If you've ever been concerned about automatic label placement hiding away important labels on your map -- this feature is for you! In QGIS 3.10 we've added an option to show \u0026quot;Unplaced labels\u0026quot; on your map, so you can see immediately exactly what's been hidden from view (AKA \u0026quot;see what others can't\u0026quot;)!\nThis new setting (which is accessed through the Labeling toolbar) will render these Unplaced Labels in a red color (but the color can be changed from the project Label Settings dialog). After identifying any missing labels in your map, we suggest you use the existing Labeling tools such as the \u0026quot;move label\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;show/hide label\u0026quot; tool to rearrange your map and make these labels visible again.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Overrun distance for line labels ¶ We understand that making a cartographic masterpiece is a demanding task, so in QGIS 3.10 we've extended the capabilities of curved labels by adding a new \u0026quot;overrun distance\u0026quot; setting. This setting allows you to control exactly how far a curved label is allowed to extend past to ends of a line feature. Bumping up the distance will result in giving the labeling engine more flexibility in placing your labels, resulting in more labels being placed in better locations on your map! Win! The setting works for both curved and parallel label modes, and supports distances in mm/map units/pixels/etc, and data-defined distances.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Data defined control for \u0026quot;label every part of multipart features\u0026quot; setting ¶ The \u0026quot;label every part\u0026quot; option was one of the very few settings which couldn't be previously data-definable for labels. We've remedied this omission in QGIS 3.10, and you can now control whether you want all parts labelled on a feature-by-feature basis!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Control \u0026quot;label all parts\u0026quot; via the label properties tool ¶ We aren't lying when we say that QGIS 3.10 is a love-letter to map labelling! Another new option we've added in this version is interactive control over whether all parts of a feature should be labeled via the Label Properties tool.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Vertical text orientation ¶ As of 3.10, QGIS is now fully equipped to render vertically oriented labels. To our Chinese, Japanese, and Korean users: spread the word! :)\nYou can choose between two vertical orientation mode: one that always renders labels vertically, or an alternative mode that dynamically picks the orientation based on the label rotation.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Control over font kerning ¶ Another option we've added for improving the conversion of ArcMap symbology to QGIS (via SLYR) is a new setting for controlling whether label fonts are kerned (or not).\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nRendering ¶ Feature: Rendering raster layers outside the reported extent ¶ Depending on the server technology used, sometimes the map extent reported by raster layers may be smaller than the actual area which can be rendered (especially notably for WMS servers with symbology which takes more space than the data extent). Previous version of QGIS would crop raster layers to the reported extents, resulting in truncated symbols on the borders of these layers. Now, there's a new option to allow you to override this behaviour and ignore the reported extent for affected servers.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (Opengis.ch)\nFeature: Georeference PDFs and TIFs when saving the map canvas as image/PDF ¶ In QGIS 3.10 we've implemented support for embedded georeferencing within PDFs and TIFs when using the save [map canvas] as image or PDF.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: New map canvas image decoration ¶ We've added a brand new decoration for the QGIS main canvas, allowing you to add a bitmap and SVG image overlay (logo, legend, etc.) to your map window.\nAs with other parts of QGIS, the image decoration supports customizable fill and outline color for parameter-enabled SVGs.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Logarithmic scale classification ¶ You can now use a logarithmic based classification technique when creating ranges for the graduated renderer.\nThis feature was developed by OPENGIS.ch\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Measurement tool in 3D map view ¶ Now you can measure distances in 3D map views! This new tool is available in the 3D map view toolbar, and has the same workflow as the 2D measurement tool (with the same configuration settings of rubber band color, units, decimal place, etc). It also has the same behavior (left-click to add a new point, middle-click to delete the last point, and right-click to restart the measurement). This allows you to measure distances in 3d, e.g. the distance between two building\u0026rsquo;s roofs or the length of a river running down a mountain. See the 3D measurement tool in action:\nThis feature was funded by Google Summer of Code Program\nThis feature was developed by Ismail Sunni\nFeature: Billboard Rendering for Points ¶ We added a new kind of rendering style for point layers. It allows you to show the point with a QGIS symbol (e.g. marker, SVG, etc) that always faces the user and always has the same size. You can see sample usage in the video.\nThis feature was funded by Google Summer of Code Program\nThis feature was developed by Ismail Sunni\nFeature: 3D On-Screen Navigation ¶ In earlier QGIS versions, you could already navigate the 3D world by using a mouse and keyboard. Unfortunately, for a new user, it is not easy to start using them! 3D On-Screen Navigation will help to navigate the 3D world. There are buttons to zoom in/out, tilt up/down, pan up/down/left/right, and rotate the 3D map view. This feature can be activated from the 3D map view toolbar. See how to use it in this video:\nThis feature was funded by Google Summer of Code Program\nThis feature was developed by Ismail Sunni\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Right-to-left arrangement for legends ¶ Thanks to funding from our right-to-left locale users, we've added a new choice for arrangement of legend elements. These include symbols to the left OR symbols to the right of the legend text, and alignment options for groups, subgroups and item text.\nThis feature allows creation of right-to-left locale friendly legends. To make things user-friendly, we even default to this right-to-left style alignment when creating new legends under a RTL based locale.\nThis feature was funded by Kaplan Open Source\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Control margin under legend group and subgroup headings ¶ If you're after pixel-perfect control over your legend appearance -- this one's for you! QGIS 3.10 now allows you to tweak the spacing applied under group or subgroup headings.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Data defined settings in text formats ¶ Since so much of QGIS' cartographic power comes from the flexibility of data-defined symbol settings, we've now allowed them to be used for text formats too! This means you can now use data defined properties wherever text formats are used, e.g. within layout scalebar text.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: @scale_value variable ¶ To complement the new support for data-defined settings within text formats, we added a new @scale_value expression variable. This can be used when evaluating data defined text format properties while rendering scale bar text, and ultimately allows you to have per-label customisation of the text format inside scale bars (e.g. showing certain distance labels in bold).\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Scalebar label placement options ¶ We've extended layout scale bars with additional styling options, adding a pair of settings to refine the placement of scalebar labels. Now you can define whether labels are shown above or below the scalebar itself, as well as setting whether labels are centered in the middle of a segment or placed at its end.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Simplify PDF or SVG exports ¶ Previous QGIS versions would often generate HUGE PDF (or SVG) outputs, as these outputs included many redundant vertices which were not discernably different at the export DPI. Now, by default, we apply a simplification while writing out PDF or SVG files, causing geometries to be simplified and automatically removing any redundant vertices which are (e.g. if export DPI is 300 dpi, vertices less then 1/600 inch different from each other will be removed).\nThis new setting, \u0026quot;Simplify geometries to reduce output file size\u0026quot;, is exposed in the SVG or PDF export settings dialogs shown when exporting a layout/atlas/report to PDF or SVG.\nNo more ridiculously complex and large export file size for your QGIS print layouts! Aside from the file size issues, these also cause problems when trying to load into other applications, e.g. Inkscape, which chokes on the huge number of vertices and grinds to a crawl.\u0026hellip; ouch!\nThis feature was funded by GeoPDF export group: Land Vorarlberg; Cantons of Zug, Thurgovia and Neuchâtel; Cities of Vienna and Dornbirn; Biodiversity Information Service for Powys \u0026amp; Brecon Beacons National Park\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved SVG layered exports ¶ User feedback told us that the way we created layered SVG files in past releases was frustrating to work with. So, in QGIS 3.10, we've revamped this feature and now SVG layer names will match the layer names from QGIS, making it much easier for designers to understand the contents of the document! Read more about this are related features here.\nThis feature was funded by GeoPDF export group\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Layout map redraw indicator ¶ In earlier QGIS releases, there was no way to tell whether a map refresh had finished inside a QGIS print layout designer window. So, we've added a new indicator in the status bar which shows whenever there's a redraw is humming away in the background. No more user confusion!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: GeoPDF Export ¶ If you export PDF's from QGIS now, there is an option to export it as GeoPDF. If you open this PDF with a compatible PDF viewer, you will then be able to toggle layers on and off, pan and zoom around the PDF and interactively interrogate features! Futhermore, you can re-import these GeoPDF documents back into QGIS as vector layers, and see all the features in their original locations and with their original attribute values.\nGeoPDF export is available for either print layouts or map canvas exports. We've added lots of flexibility to this new option, e.g. with options for controlling which layers will be exported as interactive layers. You can even choose to export multiple map themes into a single GeoPDF document, so that your readers can interactive switch between these themes! (Wow!)\nNote that GeoPDF export requires a QGIS build based on GDAL 3.0 or later.\nRead more at QGIS 3.10 Loves GeoPdf\nThis feature was funded by GeoPDF export group: Land Vorarlberg; Cantons of Zug, Thurgovia and Neuchâtel; Cities of Vienna and Dornbirn; Biodiversity Information Service for Powys \u0026amp; Brecon Beacons National Park\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Data defined control grid properties ¶ We've added data defined control over layout map grids, to give you extra flexibility in the appearance and behaviour of these grids, and to allow you to create layout templates and atlases with grids which dynamically respond to map scale changes.\nNow, you're able to set data-defined control for:\ngrid enabled state grid x/y intervals grid x/y offsets grid frame size and margin annotation distances from the grid frame grid cross size grid frame line thickness This feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Dynamic grid segment sizes ¶ Just like the existing scalebar setting of the same name, this new setting allows you to set a page-size-based range for map grid intervals. The grid interval will be dynamically calculated based on the map extent and scale to pick the largest possible \u0026quot;pretty\u0026quot; interval which results in grid sizes inside the desired range.\nThis change makes it possible for you to create layouts and layout templates with grids which respond elegantly to a wide range of map scales!\nThis feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Spatial bookmarks for layout maps ¶ Another long-requested feature we've implemented for QGIS 3.10 is a new button in the layout map item properties toolbar, which allows you to directly set a map item to the extent of a spatial bookmark!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nExpressions ¶ Feature: New expression functions ¶ attributes(): returns a map containing all attributes from a feature, with field names as map keys. We've got flexible, robust support for working with map values in expressions now, so this allows rapid conversion of all feature attributes to a map to use with these handy functions!\nNew optional \u0026quot;format\u0026quot; parameters were added to the to_date, to_datetime, and to_time functions\n| collect_geometries: this new function collects a set of geometries into a multi-part geometry object. Geometry parts can either be specified as separate arguments to the function or (more flexibly), as an array of geometry parts. This function allows geometries to be generated using iterator based approaches, such as transforming an array generated using generate_series, e.g: | collect_geometries( array_foreach( generate_series( 0, 330, 30), project($geometry, .2, radians(@element)) ) ) | Gives a nice radial effect of points surrounding the central feature point when used as a MultiPoint geometry generator\nA new make_line expression function variant which accepts an array of points. This allows creation of lines from variable numbers of points, and from sequences from aggregates/dynamically generated sequences.\nDigitising ¶ Feature: GPS timestamp support ¶ We've overhauled the existing GPS based functionality in QGIS 3.10, adding new options for automatically retrieving and storing GPS timestamps alongside GPS based features.\nThis feature was funded by NIWA\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti (North Road)\nFeature: Allowed gap exceptions ¶ In QGIS 3.4 we introduced the ability to configure QGIS layers to run topological checks on every save operation. For 3.10, we have now added a new option to the check for \u0026quot;gaps\u0026quot; which allows you to actively mark some gaps as allowed. These exceptions will be saved on a separate, configurable layer. Whenever a gap is detected, you either have the possibility to fix it or to add it to the allowed exceptions with the press of a button.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nData Management ¶ Feature: Composite Foreign Keys ¶ In QGIS 3.10, we added the possibility to create layer relationships which utilise composite foreign keys. QGIS now fully supports editing parent and child features which are linked with more than one attribute. This functionality is accessed in the Project Properties -\u0026gt; Relations tab.\nThis feature was funded by California Geological Survey\nThis feature was developed by OPENGIS.ch\nFeature: Add circular data dependencies ¶ Ever had issues with snapping when editing a feature that is modified by someone else (or a nasty database trigger)? Data dependencies allow refreshing the content of the dependent layers when the data is changed. We improved the dependencies support in QGIS by allowing refreshing the modified layer itself, which is kind of a circular dependency (a point layer and a line layer depending on each other for instance). No more snapping on ghost features!\nMore info in the pull request\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.org\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces (Oslandia)\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Update depending widgets real-time ¶ Updates widget values on real time while editing the referenced fields. When widget A contains a default value depending on widget B, it updates as soon as widget B is edited.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Schaffhausen\nThis feature was developed by David Signer (OPENGIS.ch)\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: Stored filter expressions for attribute tables ¶ While previous versions of QGIS allowed you to filter attribute tables using a custom expression, these expressions were lost whenever the attribute table was closed. Now, we've added the ability to store and manage your custom expression filters to the attribute table dialog. You can now build up your own personal collection of useful filters, which will always be available for re-use with a few simple mouse clicks!\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Schaffhausen\nThis feature was developed by David Signer (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: New operators for Raster Calculator ¶ You ask, we listen: abs , min and max are now available in the Raster Calculator user interface!\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nProcessing ¶ Feature: New algorithm \u0026quot;Point to layer\u0026quot; ¶ This algorithm creates a new vector layer which contains a single feature with geometry matching a point parameter. It can be used in models to convert a point input into a layer, which can then be used for other algorithms which require a layer based input.\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang\nFeature: Advanced model parameters ¶ When creating inputs for a Processing model, you can now mark these input parameters as \u0026quot;Advanced\u0026quot; options. (Advanced parameters are hidden by default when users run your model through the Processing toolbox)\nThis feature was developed by Alex Bruy\nFeature: All GDAL based algorithms now support free-form \u0026quot;additional parameters\u0026quot; ¶ We added an optional \u0026quot;Additional command-line parameters\u0026quot; parameter to all GDAL algorithms , useful for cases when you need to pass a specific command-line argument(s) which is not exposed in the algorithm UI.\nThis feature was developed by Alex Bruy\nFeature: Metatile size for XYZ tiles ¶ You can now specify a custom metatile size when generating XYZ tiles. Larger values may speed up the rendering of tiles and provide better labelling (fewer gaps without labels) at the expense of using more memory.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias\nFeature: New parameter type for colors ¶ QGIS 3.10 brings a new parameter type for use in Processing models and scripts, which allows for users to pick a color value. Useful for any models and algorithms which require a color value as an input!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New algorithm \u0026quot;Create style database from project\u0026quot; ¶ This algorithm extracts all style objects (symbols, color ramps, text formats and label settings) from a QGIS project and stores them in a new style XML database, which can then be managed and imported via the Style Manager dialog.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: File filter and default values for file and folder inputs in models ¶ For file or folder inputs in Processing models we've added a new file filter setting (with some standard file formats available as an optional preset), and now allow you to set a default value for these inputs.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New algorithm \u0026quot;Combine style databases\u0026quot; ¶ The new \u0026quot;Combine style databases\u0026quot; algorithm combines multiple QGIS style databases into a single output style database. If any symbols exist with duplicate names between the different source databases these will be renamed to have unique names in the output combined database. It's designed to give users an easy way to condense multiple separate style databases into a single unified database.\nIt works brilliantly with results generated by running the \u0026quot;Create style database from project\u0026quot; in a batch mode!\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Generate XYZ tiles using multiple threads ¶ The existing Generate XYZ tiles algorithm has been optimised and can now generate tiles using multiple processing threads.\nThis feature was developed by Isghj5\nFeature: New algorithms for exporting and importing bookmarks to/from map layers ¶ To complement the spatial bookmark overhaul in QGIS 3.10, we've added new Processing algorithms which allow you to create a bunch of new bookmarks corresponding to the features from a layer, or to export existing spatial bookmark extents to a new polygon layer.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New algorithm \u0026quot;Split features by character\u0026quot; ¶ This brand new algorithm splits features into multiple output features, by splitting a field value with a specified character.\nFor instance, if a layer contains features with multiple comma separated values contained in a single field, this algorithm can be used to split these values up across multiple output features. Geometries and other attributes remain unchanged in the output.\nOptionally, the separator string can be a regular expression for added flexibility.\nThis algorithm was designed for use in models which need to process input files with multiple concatenated values in a single attribute, e.g. geocoding a table with \u0026quot;address1,address2,address3\u0026quot; format strings.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New algorithm Climb Along Line ¶ Previously available as a plugin, the \u0026quot;Climb Along Line\u0026quot; algorithm has been added to the out-of-the-box QGIS toolset. This algorithm calculates the accumulated height differences for lines in an input line layer, calculated using the Z values of the line vertices. A copy of the input line layer is returned with additional attributes for accumulated climb and descent, as well as the minimum and maximum Z values for each line.\nThis feature was developed by Håvard Tveite (NMBU) and Matteo Ghetta (Faunalia)\nFeature: Port Create Grid algorithm to C++ ¶ We ported the Create Grid algorithm from Python to C++ in order to speed up the algorithm. The algorithm now performs much faster for you and is also capable of creating point|line|rectangle|diamond|hexagon regular vector grids in high resolution in huge extents (eg. whole nations) in a reasonable amount of time.\nThis feature was funded by Clemens Raffler\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Extract symbols from QGIS projects within the browser ¶ QGIS' Browser panel just keeps getting more and more powerful! In 3.10, we've added a new option when right-clicking a QGIS project within the browser: \u0026quot;Extract Symbols\u0026quot;. Selecting this option opens a style manager dialog showing all symbols, color ramps, text formats and label settings from the selected project, allowing you to easily export the browse these symbols.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nGeneral ¶ Feature: Show news items on welcome page ¶ A curated QGIS news feed is now shown on the welcome page. This finally gives us a direct channel to push project news to ALL our users! Expect to see lots of interesting QGIS news, tips, and events coming your way!\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.org\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Milliradians (SI definition) and mil (NATO) units ¶ QGIS 3.10 allows you to measure angles in two new units, milliradians (SI definition) and mil (NATO) units.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Interface Customization dialog filtering ¶ We've added a new \u0026quot;search\u0026quot; box to the Interface Customization dialog, which allows you to filter through the widgets and easily find the widget you are trying to customize...\nThis feature was developed by DelazJ\nFeature: Improved auto-fix broken layers ¶ When a layer path is fixed in a project, QGIS 3.10 will automatically scan through all other broken paths and try to auto-fix any others which were also pointing to the same original broken file path. Any change which speeds up fixing broken layer paths is a welcome change in our view!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Spatial bookmarks supercharged! ¶ We've totally revamped how spatial bookmarks are exposed and managed in QGIS 3.10. Spatial Bookmarks are now shown in the browser panel, and can be regrouped into custom, categorized folders. This offers a much easier way to navigate and manage your bookmarks.\nWe also added a brand new bookmark editor dialog, which features an extent widget that greatly facilitates bookmark editing.\nBookmarks can also now be dragged and dropped onto canvases, allowing secondary canvases to zoom to a particular bookmark. This allows bookmarks to play nice in multi-canvas projects, since you can drop them onto a specific canvas to zoom.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin, Nyall Dawson\nFeature: \u0026quot;Reselect Features\u0026quot; action in Edit -\u0026gt; Select menu ¶ Ever spend 10 minutes painstakingly creating an interactive selection of features, only to accidentally deselect them all through an errant mouse click? If so, this feature is designed just for you! Now, you can restore a layer's selection following a selection clear operation via the new \u0026quot;Reselect Features\u0026quot; option in the Edit menu.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Parallelize snap index build ¶ The idea was to parallelize for each layer the snap cache computing (sequential at the moment) and to make it non blocking. As a consequence it is still possible to use QGIS even if snap cache is currently building. User can for instance start to edit node while the snap cache build is in progress.\nThis feature was developed by Oslandia\nFeature: Templates for QGIS Projects ¶ QGIS 3.10 includes the ability to directly use Project Templates from the welcome page. Additionally, you can now ship project templates to your whole organisation by placing them in a system folder, next to the already existing possibility to put it into a user profile folder.\nThis feature was funded by The QGIS Project\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Read-write support for .shz and .shp.zip ¶ For QGIS builds based on GDAL 3.1, you can now open and edit single-layer ZIP compressed shapefiles (.shz), or multi-layer ones (.shp.zip). Regardless of where you sit on the Shapefile vs Geopackage battle, you'll welcome this ability to de-clutter your folders and store shapefiles as a single file!\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nFeature: Oracle provider authentication ¶ We've updated the Oracle database provider to add full support for QGIS built-in authentication system.\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer\nFeature: Improved PostGIS raster support ¶ PostGIS raster layers are now shown in the Browser panel and from the Data Source Manager dialog, allowing you to easily manage and add these layers to your projects. Currently only read support from browser is supported - you cannot drag rasters into a PostGIS database using the browser.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Oracle - Database transaction support ¶ For version 3.10, we've enhanced the Oracle database provider and added support for editing layers via transactions.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Z/M dimensions in delimited text layers ¶ We've added optional support for Z and M fields to QGIS' delimited text provider, allowing you to create Z or M enabled layers directly from CSV files.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Static data providers ¶ One huge behind-the-scenes job we completed for QGIS 3.10 is a refactoring of the provider infrastructure. Now, providers allow both dynamic and static linking. This was a pre-requisite to be able to build QGIS libraries on platforms that do not support dynamic linkage (iOS), and allows for QGIS based tools like the Input data collection app to be distributed for iOS based devices!\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting Ltd.\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik, Martin Dobias\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Using SVG in QGIS Server ¶ Earlier QGIS server versions had rendering issues when remote SVG files were used in a project (e.g. those hosted via external http servers). We've improved how QGIS Server fetches these resources, and it's now possible to use remote SVG paths in your layers and publish them as WMS without rendering issues in QGIS Server.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by René-Luc D'Hont (3Liz)\nFeature: WMS dimension ¶ In QGIS 3.10 a WMS server can provide support for several type of dimensions such as time, elevation or other types of dimensions. The dimension has to be defined as the layer level and can be used by the WMS client to filter requested information. WMS Time is part of the WMS Dimension.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by René-Luc D'Hont (3Liz)\nFeature: Server OAPIF (aka WFS3) support ¶ QGIS 3.10 Server is one of the very first geospatial servers which supports the new OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core standard (also known as WFS3)!\nThis is a completely new implementation that provides an HTML and JSON based service for your web mapping developments, including a simple WebGIS interface which is available out of the box and it is easily customizable through an HTML template system.\nMore information is available in the documentation\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: New class QgsBookmarkManager ¶ Attached to QgsProject and QgsApplication, this new class provides a stable, supported method of managing project and global bookmarks (vs the old undocumented, not stable approach of directly manipulating project keys or a sqlite database). Now your plugins and scripts are capable of reading, modifying, and managing spatial bookmarks!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New API for provider database connections ¶ Thanks to funding from the QGIS grant program, you can now use a new API aimed to manage DB connections in a unified way. The new connection API also provides a set of useful methods that can be used by plugin authors to access information about tables, schemas etc. and to run SQL arbitrary queries and get the results back into a handy Python array.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti ¶ Bug Title URL issues (if

Whenever a new project is created, it will inherit this default setting.\nThe Project Properties dialog also has a new setting for the project-specific bearing format.\nThe intention is that whenever angular bearings are shown in QGIS, they will be formatted using the current project's bearing format settings.\nAlso includes lots of nice API additions providing a stable, easy to discover place for setting and retrieving settings like the bearing format.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Deselecting tables when adding PostgreSQL data after add button is clicked. ¶ When adding PostgreSQL data in Data Source Manager after pressing the add button QGIS should deselect previously selected tables.\nThis feature was funded by Kartoza\nThis feature was developed by Samweli Mwakisambwe\nFeature: Show the total pan distance and bearing in the status bar ¶ We added the total pan distance and bearing in the status bar during canvas pan operations. Allows users to know exactly how far (and in what direction) they've dragged the map.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New option to set the default project file format (qgs/qgz) ¶ This adds a new global option to define the preferred project file format\nThis feature was funded by GEM foundation\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Fix invalid attributes dialog on copy to another layer ¶ It's possible to copy features from one layer to another. If there are the same fields in the destination layer, then the attributes for them are taken from the original feature. If not, the default value is taken. Otherwise, the new attribute is null.\nIf the destination layer has constraints on the fields, these should be fulfilled now or disregarded on purpose. But not just copied invalid like it used to do.\nThat's why now the attributes are checked against the constraints. And for all the invalid features a dialog pops up.\nAnd on pasting only one feature, the options are reduced:\nThis feature was developed by signedav\nFeature: Allow dropping a map layer from the layer tree onto a projection selection widget ¶ ...to set the projection to match that layer. Just a little timesaving shortcut!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Processing raster calc: add missing btns and validate ¶ Add missing buttons for ABS/MIN/MAX and validate expression.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Vector Trace Animation and Streamlines for Mesh Layer ¶ Mesh vector renderer now can visualize streamlines and particles on top of existing \u0026quot;arrow\u0026quot; mode.\nThis feature was funded by TUFLOW\nThis feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Selective masking ¶ A new advanced rendering feature has been added: selective masking. It allows the definition of 'masks' areas around labels or point markers. These masks will \u0026quot;un-draw\u0026quot; only some symbol layers of other layers underneath, chosen by the user.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.CH and others through a cofunding campaign\nThis feature was developed by Hugo Mercier (Oslandia)\nFeature: When decimal degrees rotation fails to evaluate, fallback to static value ¶ The legend finally also works nicely with data defined rotation. QGIS could already apply data defined rotation to symbols and individual symbol layers, but this resulted in a broken legend. The rotation of symbols (and symbol parts defined on symbol layers) on the legend can now be controlled by changing the default values next to the data defined properties.\nThe old behavior was to always fall back to 0 in case of a failing expression. Which made it hard to create a proper legend in some cases.\ne.g. if you had two symbol layers with the following expressions for their rotation\n\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot; And\n90 + \u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot; which would be two orthogonal symbol layers (e.g. denote a right angle), rotated by an orientation field.\nNow in the legend (and symbol preview), both layers would be shown with a rotation of 0, because there is no associated feature with a field orientation.\nThe new behavior is to fall back to the static, configured values which makes it very intuitive to configure the legend for these cases.\nBefore\nAfter\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Add density-based point count for the random marker fill ¶ This feature adds a density-based point count method to the new random marker fill.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Random marker fill symbol layer type ¶ This feature adds a new fill symbol layer type \u0026quot;Random marker fill\u0026quot;. It allows polygon features to be rendered using a marker symbol placed at random locations within the polygon boundary.\nOptions include:\nnumber of marker symbols to render for the polygon whether markers rendered near the edges of polygons should be clipped to the polygon boundary or not an optional random number seed, to give consistent placement of markers whenever maps are refreshed (also allows random placement to play nice with QGIS server and tile-based rendering) This feature was funded by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add option to set color for rendering nodata pixels in raster layers ¶ Allows raster nodata pixels to be colored in a specific (non-transparent) color. Designed to match the \u0026quot;Display background value\u0026quot; option from ArcMap.\nThis feature was funded by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Allow to delete custom label position ¶ We added a new possibility option to delete custom label position by pressing DEL key when moving the label.\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nDiagrams ¶ Feature: Paint effect support for diagram renderer ¶ this new feature allows for diagrams to use paint effects, including drop shadows, outer glows, etc...\nThis feature was funded by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New diagram type \u0026quot;stacked bars\u0026quot; ¶ With this new feature users will have possibility to create stacks bars of varying colors for each attribute on top of each other vertically or horizontally. Designed to match the \u0026quot;Stacked\u0026quot; chart renderer option available in ArcGIS.\nThis feature was funded by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Spacing option for vector layer bar chart diagrams ¶ Allows for user-controlled spacing between each bar in the chart.\nThis feature was funded by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New option to control pie diagram angular direction ¶ This feature allows to control whether the sections are rendered in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.\nThis feature was funded by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nRendering ¶ Feature: Play/Stop Buttons for Mesh Layer Playback ¶ It is possible to switch the timeframes of mesh layer's datasets by play/stop button. The playback setting could be adjusted in the time setting dialog.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting\nFeature: On the Fly Resampling of Data Defined on Faces to Vertices (Mesh Layer) ¶ For datasets defined on faces, one can choose to interpolate data to vertices with neighbour average method. When no data interpolation method is chosen, each pixel on a single face has a single value/color. With data on vertices, the rendering for each pixel is interpolated from the values on the vertices, making smoother figures.\nUse mesh contours styling panel to switch between the data interpolation methods.\nThis feature was funded by Austrian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Support for Mesh Reference Time ¶ For various dataset types, for example GRIB and NetCDF, the reference time in QGIS time settings dialog is prepopulated from the raw data and does not need to be set manually. Also we fixed various bugs related to time parsing, so in QGIS 3.12 it should be possible to format and show your time in plots/animations in the proper way:\nIf there is a valid time reference provided with dataset groups, this time reference is used to displaying time (using absolute time). If there is no reference time provided, the time is displayed using relative time, and a time reference can be set by the user to display the absolute time. When no time reference is provided, the default one is the current date + time set with 00:00:00. A push-button is added to reload the reference time provided with dataset groups if needed.\nIt also adds a new feature to let the user set the time unit of the provider with a combo box if this time unit is different than hours.\nThis feature was funded by TUFLOW\nThis feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec (Lutra Consulting)\n3D Features ¶ Feature: 3D Mesh Layer Terrain Renderer ¶ It is possible to render the mesh layer in the 3D view as terrain.\nThe user can choose those enable/disable smooth triangles and wireframe. It is possible to choose the line width and the line color of the wireframe, change the vertical scale and choose the style of the rendering (unique color or color ramp shading).\nThere are two entries to render the mesh layer in the 3D view :\nchoose the mesh as the terrain in the config widget activate the 3D view in the layer properties. The user can choose those settings:\nenable/disable smooth triangles enable/disable wireframe choose the line width and the line color of the wireframe change the verticale scale choose the style of the rendering : unique color or color ramp shading settings the color ramp shading as for raster layer For now, the mesh can be rendered as a TIN but rendering dataset is not supported. However, the infrastructure is adapted for a future round of work.\nThis feature was funded by TUFLOW\nThis feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Load 3D vector layer data in background + tiling ¶ This adds support for background loading of data from vector layers into 3D map views. Until now, loading (and tessellation) would freeze the GUI completely - this could take many seconds depending on the complexity of input data.\nThe basic vector layer renderer and rule-based renderer were converted to use QgsChunkedEntity which is already used for terrain rendering. There are two more improvements in addition to unlocking of GUI:\nloading process is multi-threaded instead of using just a single core loading is done in tiles - so it is possible to see the tiles with 3D data appearing while other data are still being loaded There is a new configuration option in the 3D tab of vector layers - it determines how deep the quadtree will be. For example, one zoom level means there will be a single tile for the whole layer. Three zoom levels means there will be 16 tiles at the leaf level (every extra zoom level multiplies that by 4, so I have limited GUI to max. 8 levels which gives ~16K tiles which is already a lot).\nHow a vector layer's tiling quadtree gets populated: all internal tree nodes are empty and thus the 3D map scene tries to immediately replace them with their children - this goes until leaf nodes are reached. Only nodes at the leaf level currently hold any data. This may change in the future when we introduce more elaborate strategies - for example, internal nodes may contain a small percentage of features of the child nodes (this would allow us to show something while zoomed out a lot, not requiring to load all data).\nFor debugging purposes, there is also a new configuration option \u0026quot;show bounding boxes\u0026quot;. This allows you to see the bounding box of each tile (especially useful if there are some issues with tiles not showing up when they should).\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.org grant.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Allow drag and drop of pictures onto map layouts ¶ This new feature allows user e.g. drag an svg from a file explorer onto the layout to create a new picture item containing that svg image.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New layout item type: manually created fixed tables ¶ This new item type allows for the creation of tables with contents manually entered by users (i.e. spreadsheet-style) so that users can create completely custom tables. Supports control custom cell contents, foreground and background colors (and soon, preset row and column heights). A brand new table designer dialog has been added which allows for customization of these tables.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add user control over scalebar numeric formats ¶ You now have the option for controlling the numeric format used by a layout scalebar.\nYou can manage all the formatting properties for the numbers in scale bars, including whether they want a thousand separator, decimal places, scientific notation, etc. Very useful in the case of making maps for audiences outside of the current QGIS locale, or when you'd just prefer to vary the style from the locale defaults (e.g. adding thousands separators when the locale default is to hide them).\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow layout attribute tables to be styled using the foreground and background colors of matching conditional styles ¶ When the new \u0026quot;Apply layer conditional styling colors\u0026quot; option is enabled in the layout attribute table settings, any conditional styling rules present in the layer will be applied inside the layout attribute table (foreground and background colors only, for now!).\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add search box to layout manager ¶ Allows filtering the list of layouts in a project by name, handy when a project has many layouts..!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Search Tags for Functions ¶ Tags on static expression functions to make them more retrievable. Functions like array_to_string are listed when the user enters \u0026quot;split\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;convert\u0026quot; or - like before - a part of the function name.\nThis feature was funded by SwissTierras-Colombia\nThis feature was developed by David Signer (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: List Referenced Layer Values ¶ When a field is a RelationReference, ValueRelation and ValueMap, there is the possibility not only to show the values of the current layer but also the possible values in the referenced layer / configured possibilities.\nThis feature was funded by SwissTierras-Colombia\nThis feature was developed by David Signer (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: New expressions ¶ is_empty(geom), check if a geometry is empty (geometry that contain no coordinates) is_empty_or_null(geom), check if a geometry is empty or NULL (does not have geometry) hash, cryptographic hashes functions using QCryptographicHash. Use case is the same as PgCrypto but in client side for all supported format. This feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti (Oslandia)\nFeature: New algorithm \u0026quot;Rename table field\u0026quot; ¶ Takes an input layer, existing field and a new name for the field, and outputs a new layer with the selected field renamed.\nWhile this result could also be achieved with the Refactor Fields algorithm, Refactor Fields isn't particularly model friendly. It relies on a constant, fixed table structure, and can't adapt to input tables with different field structures.\nIn contrast, this simple Rename Field algorithm adapts nicely for model use, because it operates on a single field only and leaves all the other fields untouched.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Stored expressions ¶ Store user expressions Clear editor icon/action See also QEP https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/135\nThis feature was funded by Salvatore Fiandaca\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: List referenced layer values in Expression Builder ¶ When a field is a RelationReference, ValueRelation and ValueMap, there is the possibility not only to show the values of the current layer but also the possible values in the referenced layer / configured possibilities.\nage is a ValueMap, species is a ValueRelation and island_id is a RelationReference\nIn the example we have the persons:\nGeorge (in Cuba, in his twenties, human) Paul (in Vietnam, in his thirties, human) Ringo (in Venezuela, in his forties, cat) John (in Vietnam as well, in his forties, table) And the entries in the country layer are USSR, Cuba, Vietnam, Burma, Venezuela, North Korea This feature was developed by signedav\nFeature: Add expression functions for converting to/from wkb ¶ geom_from_wkb( geom_to_wkb( make_point(4,5) ) ) → a point geometry object Returns a geometry created from a Well-Known Binary (WKB) representation. geom_to_wkb( $geometry ) → binary blob containing a geometry object Returns the Well-Known Binary (WKB) representation of a geometry as a binary blob. Adds geom_from_wkb and geom_to_wkb, which mirror the existing geom_from_wkt/geom_to_wkt functions but for WKB representations of geometries.\nSince QGIS 3.6 we've had good support for binary blob values in expressions and field values, so adding these functions allows users to work with binary blob fields containing WKB representations of geometries (e.g. with a geometry generator showing the encoded geometries)\nThis feature was funded by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: is_valid expression ¶ is_valid(geom_from_wkt('LINESTRING(0 0, 1 1, 2 2, 0 0)')) → true Returns true if a geometry is valid; if it is well-formed in 2D according to the OGC rules\nAdd an is_valid function to the expressions, which reuses GEOS is valid and returns true if a geometry is valid; if it is well-formed in 2D according to the OGC rules.\nThis feature was developed by Pete King\nFeature: Add datetime_from_epoch (MSec from epoch) expression function ¶ datetime_from_epoch(1483225200000) → 2017-01-01T00:00:00 Returns a datetime whose date and time are the number of milliseconds, msecs, that have passed since 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000, Coordinated Universal Time (Qt.UTC), and converted to Qt.LocalTime.\nThis feature was developed by Richard Duivenvoorde\nFeature: rotate() expression function ¶ rotate($geometry, 45, make_point(4, 5)) → geometry rotated 45 degrees clockwise around the (4, 5) point Returns a rotated version of a geometry. Calculations are in the Spatial Reference System of this geometry.\nThis feature was developed by Raymond Nijssen, Nyall Dawson\nFeature: allow to seed random functions ¶ rand(10, 80, 1) → 30 Returns a random integer within the range specified by the minimum and maximum argument (inclusive). If a seed is provided, the returned will always be the same, depending on the seed. randf(10, 80, 1) → 19.37136508087729 Returns a random float within the range specified by the minimum and maximum argument (inclusive). If a seed is provided, the returned will always be the same, depending on the seed. This feature adds an optional seed parameter to rand() and randf() functions This is very useful if you want the result to be deterministic, for instance to assign random but fixed colors to features. Using color_hsb(rand(0,360,$id),50,50) for instance yields always the same color for the same feature. We also improves the rand() function, which didn't work for high values (over 32000) by using Qt's QRandomGenerator instead of qrand (which it seems was deprecated in Qt 5.11).\nThis feature was developed by olivierdalang\nFeature: Language support for format_date() and to_{date,datetime,time}() ¶ format_date('2012-05-15','d MMMM yyyy','fr') → '15 mai 2012' format_date('2012-05-15','d MMMM yyyy','it') → '15 maggio 2012' format_date('2012-05-15','d MMMM yyyy','en') → '15 May 2012' Formats a date type or string into a custom string format. Uses Qt date/time format strings. See QDateTime::toString. By default, those expression use the application's locale. The addition of an optional language parameter allows handling of dates that wouldn't match that default locale (say for e.g. an English system running QGIS trying to transform a French-formatted string into a date object).\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Edit Invalid Attributes on Copy/Paste to Another Layer ¶ On copy-paste features from one layer to another, in case there are constraints (e.g. not null) on the destination layer, that cannot bee fulfilled automatically by default values, a dialog pops up to fix the invalid attributes or disregard the constraints on purpose.\nThis feature was funded by Amt für Wald und Wild Zug\nThis feature was developed by David Signer (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Snapping cache parallelization ¶ In previous version of QGIS, the snapping index cache was built sequentially and you had to wait for all your layers to be indexed before starting edition. Thanks to the QGIS.org grant program, QGIS now builds the snapping index cache in parallel for each layer, so it speeds up the whole process. Snapping has also been relaxed, meaning that you don't have to wait for the cache to be complete, you can start editing and snapping information will appear as soon as they are ready.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.org\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces (Oslandia)\nData Management ¶ Feature: DXF Export Improvements ¶ We did a revamp of the DXF export process. This solidifies the export process and offers new features.\nStyles of geometries are exported and blocks are used The Z coordinate of 3D geometries are preserved Labels are exported with their anchor points and horizontal and vertical alignment or quadrant settings respected The whole DXF export process has also been made ready for running in a thread. With this in place, it's now only one step away from being sent to the background, allow cancellation of an ongoing export process or being exposed as a processing algorithm.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Schaffhausen\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Create geometric feature from the relation editor ¶ We added the ability to add a new feature and digitize its geometry directly from within the relation editor widget. It's now easier to add a geometric feature related to your currently displayed parent feature.\nThis feature was funded by QWAT user group\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces (Oslandia)\nFeature: Improve feature selection dialog ¶ From the relation editor widget, you can link your currently displayed feature with existing features. The feature selection dialog allows you to choose these features. Thanks to the QWAT user group, feature selection is now shared with the canvas' one so it is easy to find out and pick the feature you want to link. We have also added the ability to filter displayed features (selected ones, visible on map, matching an expression...) reusing the same widgets already existing in attribute form.\nThis feature was funded by QWAT user group\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces (Oslandia)\nFeature: UX improvements in drag'n'drop form designer ¶ The drag'n'drop form designer has received some nice UX improvements\nThe two lists (available fields and layout tree) are now synchronized: whenever you select an entry in a list, the matching item is selected in the other one. Hidden config dialogs (under double-click) have been brought to the right panel This feature was funded by QGIS.org bugfixing\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud, OPENGIS.ch\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: Support for displaying WMTS legend graphics in layer tree ¶ We added support for displaying WMTS legend graphics directly in the layer tree, as is already the case with WMS legend graphics.\nExample:\nSample use case: https://wmts10.geo.admin.ch/EPSG/2056/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml\nThis feature was developed by Sandro Mani\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: Smooth Export of the Contours from Mesh Layer ¶ A new algorithm in QGIS\u0026rsquo;s analysis library API to export directly contour lines and polygons is added. The method is not based on GDAL algorithms, but directly uses mesh layer triangular mesh interpolation methods. It is both fast and with smooth shapes, matching rendered images from QGIS. You can try the new processing algorithm in Crayfish processing toolbox.\nThis feature was funded by Austrian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Support of Datasets Defined on Faces in QGIS Mesh Calculator ¶ You can use mesh calculator for all dataset types, both defined on faces and vertices. Additionally, it allows users to store the result of mesh calculator under different name or format. This allows for example to work with FLO-2D or HEC-RAS data in the QGIS mesh calculator\nThis feature was funded by Austrian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Package new layers to existing GeoPackage ¶ We improved the existing package layers processing algorithm to be able to add new layers to existing GeoPackages. All you need to do to make use of this is disable the OVERWRITE parameter and specify an existing GeoPackage.\nThis feature was funded by BikePlan\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Fuzzy Logic - Fuzzfiy Raster (linear membership) ¶ The Fuzzify raster (linear membership) algorithm is a native implementation of a fuzzy logic algorithm. It transforms an input raster to a fuzzified raster and thereby assigns values between 0 and 1 following a linear fuzzy membership function. The value of 0 implies no membership with the defined fuzzy set, a value of 1 depicts full membership. In between, the degree of membership of raster values follows a linear membership function.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Fuzzy Logic - Fuzzfiy Raster (power membership) ¶ The Fuzzify raster (power membership) algorithm is a native implementation of a fuzzy logic algorithm. It transforms an input raster to a fuzzified raster and thereby assigns values between 0 and 1 following a power fuzzy membership function. The value of 0 implies no membership with the defined fuzzy set, a value of 1 depicts full membership. In between, the degree of membership of raster values follows a power membership function.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Fuzzy Logic - Fuzzfiy Raster (small membership) ¶ The Fuzzify raster (small membership) algorithm is a native implementation of a fuzzy logic algorithm. It transforms an input raster to a fuzzified raster and thereby assigns values between 0 and 1 following the 'small' fuzzy membership function. The value of 0 implies no membership with the defined fuzzy set, a value of 1 depicts full membership. In between, the degree of membership of raster values follows the 'small' membership function. The 'small' function is constructed using two user-defined input raster values which set the point of half membership (midpoint, results to 0.5) and a predefined function spread which controls the function uptake.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Fuzzy Logic - Fuzzfiy Raster (large membership) ¶ The Fuzzify raster (large membership) algorithm is a native implementation of a fuzzy logic algorithm. It transforms an input raster to a fuzzified raster and thereby assigns values between 0 and 1 following the 'large' fuzzy membership function. The value of 0 implies no membership with the defined fuzzy set, a value of 1 depicts full membership. In between, the degree of membership of raster values follows the 'large' membership function.The 'large' function is constructed using two user-defined input raster values which set the point of half membership (midpoint, results to 0.5) and a predefined function spread which controls the function uptake.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Fuzzy Logic - Fuzzfiy Raster (gaussian membership) ¶ The Fuzzify raster (gaussian membership) algorithm is a native implementation of a fuzzy logic algorithm. It transforms an input raster to a fuzzified raster and thereby assigns values between 0 and 1 following the 'gaussian' fuzzy membership function. The value of 0 implies no membership with the defined fuzzy set, a value of 1 depicts full membership. In between, the degree of membership of raster values follows the 'gaussian' membership function. The gaussian function is constructed using two user-defined input values which set the midpoint of the gaussian function (midpoint, results to 1) and a predefined function spread which controls the function spread.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Fuzzy Logic - Fuzzfiy Raster (near membership) ¶ The Fuzzify raster (near membership) algorithm is a native implementation of a fuzzy logic algorithm. It transforms an input raster to a fuzzified raster and thereby assigns values between 0 and 1 following the 'near' fuzzy membership function. The value of 0 implies no membership with the defined fuzzy set, a value of 1 depicts full membership. In between, the degree of membership of raster values follows the 'near' membership function. The near function is constructed using two user-defined input values which set the midpoint of the near function (midpoint, results to 1) and a predefined function spread which controls the function spread.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Port Densify by count Algorithm to C++ ¶ We ported the Densify by count algorithm to C++ in order to enhance it's speed when compared to the previous Python implementation. The new algorithm also exposes the count parameter as dynamic parameter so that it can be controlled by expressions or field values.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Port Random points in extent algorithm to C++ ¶ We ported the Random points in extent algorithm to C++. This boosts it's speed when comparing it to the previous Python implementation. The new algorithm also exposes an advanced parameter of maximum numbers of retrys for the algorithm when searching for randomly placed points that respect a certain distance between all points.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Line density algorithm ¶ In this version we added a native algorithm to calculate the raster based density of lines. This algorithm calculates the line density based on a search radius and weights of the lines inside the search radius. The algorithm was ported to provide more functionality form the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension in QGIS.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: New algorithm \u0026quot;Repair Shapefile\u0026quot; ¶ We added a new algorithm which uses GDAL to repair shapefiles which have a broken or missing .SHX file.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add new algorithm \u0026quot;Detect Dataset Changes\u0026quot; ¶ This algorithm compares two vector layers, and determines which features are unchanged, added or deleted between the two. It is designed for comparing two different versions of the same dataset.\nWhen comparing features, the original and revised feature geometries will be compared against each other. Depending on the Geometry Comparison Behavior setting, the comparison will either be made using an exact comparison (where geometries must be an exact match for each other, including the order and count of vertices) or a topological comparison only (where are geometries area considered equal if all of the their component edges overlap. E.g. lines with the same vertex locations but opposite direction will be considered equal by this method). If the topological comparison is selected then any z or m values present in the geometries will not be compared.\nBy default, the algorithm compares all attributes from the original and revised features. If the Attributes to Consider for Match parameter is changed, then only the selected attributes will be compared (e.g. allowing users to ignore a timestamp or ID field which is expected to change between the revisions).\nIf any features in the original or revised layers do not have an associated geometry, then care must be taken to ensure that these features have a unique set of attributes selected for comparison. If this condition is not met, warnings will be raised and the resultant outputs may be misleading.\nThe algorithm outputs three layers, one containing all features which are considered to be unchanged between the revisions, one containing features deleted from the original layer which are not present in the revised layer, and one containing features add to the revised layer which are not present in the original layer.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New mode to \u0026quot;Join Attributes by Location\u0026quot; to take attributes from matching feature with largest area of overlap only ¶ This allows for easy polygon-\u0026gt;polygon joins, where you expect there to be only a single matching feature and don't want to include features which are just touching or have just tiny sliver polygon overlaps.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add native affine transform algorithm for vectors ¶ Offers the following benefits over the GRASS/SAGA versions:\nFull support for z/m values and handling curved geometries without loss of curves Works with all native data types, no need for format transformation Supports dynamic (data defined, per feature) translate/scale/rotate parameters Allows transformation and scaling of both Z and M values (if present) Supports in-place edit mode This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: add gdal_viewshed algorithm ¶ Expose new gdal_viewshed tool via Processing toolbox. Note: this requires GDAL \u0026gt;= 3.1.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Customization of the items shown in browser ¶ Add customization of the items shown in browser to the Interface Customization dialog. User can hide some of the root items in the browser panel (e.g. Favourites, PostGIS provider, MSSQL, Oracle, Volumes, ...)\nThis feature was funded by Limerick City and County Council\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Show html files in browser panel ¶ This feature allows .htm(l) files to be shown and opened from the browser panel. These are often used to document data files or mapping projects.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Show \u0026quot;Open Document...\u0026quot; action in browser ¶ When right clicking certain files in the browser, allowing them to be opened with the default external application for that file type\nE.g. PDFs will open with the default external PDF viewer.\nWorks with PDF, ODS, XLS(X), CSV, TXT, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, SVG (other types will likely need more work, since they aren't currently shown in the browser).\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Allow customization of the items shown in browser ¶ You can now customize items shown in the browser. User can decide (in the Interface Customization dialog) to hide some of the root items in the browser panel (e.g. Favourites, or POSTGIS provider, ...)\nThis feature was funded by Limerick City and County Council\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik\nFeature: Add Refresh action to OGC services ¶ You can now refresh OGC services in the browser. Below is a screenshot showing an example of how this function works in WMS/WMTS connections:\nThis feature was developed by Samweli Mwakisambwe\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Changed WMTS layer collection icon ¶ This was a change of the icon used for WMTS layer collection item, a database schema was used instead of a WMTS related icon. A general WMS icon is now used.\nThis feature was funded by Kartoza\nThis feature was developed by Samweli Mwakisambwe\nFeature: Added Metadata URL property in the layer metadata tab for WMS / WMTS and WCS services ¶ This feature was funded by Kartoza\nThis feature was developed by Samweli Mwakisambwe\nFeature: Fetch and show dimensions metadata for a WMS layer metadata ¶ This feature was funded by Kartoza\nThis feature was developed by Samweli Mwakisambwe\nFeature: Added refresh action to OGC services entries ¶ This feature was funded by Kartoza\nThis feature was developed by Samweli Mwakisambwe\nFeature: 3d Stacked Meshes ¶ MDAL and QGIS now supports 3D Stacked Meshes, particularly for TUFLOW-FV format. For this release, you need to choose appropriate averaging method in the QGIS interface and you are able to browse the data similarly to any other 2D dataset.\nThis feature was funded by TUFLOW\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Fix numerous shapefile encoding issues ¶ This fixes the (broken by design?) handling of Shapefile encoding, which has been an ongoing issue for years in QGIS.\nSee discussion at\n#21264 http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Shapefile-with-file-cpg-codepage-td5275106.html http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-ignore-the-cpg-files-when-loading-shapefiles-td5348021.html (+ others!)\nThe situation was that we had two different code paths for handling GDAL side attribute decoding OR QGIS side decoding. Unfortunately, they are both incompatible with each other, and due to GDAL API for this, we can't unify the two approaches. (More technical detail in the commit log message!)\nSo, now we:\nalways do the decoding on QGIS' side. This allows users to manually override a shapefile's declared encoding because they are often incorrect! use a port of GDAL's shapefile detection logic (it's not exposed in GDAL API, so I had to re-implement it here) so that we default to reading shapefiles by respecting the embedded encoding information (via CPG files or DBF LDID information) Completely remove the confusing/broken \u0026quot;Ignore shapefile encoding declaration\u0026quot; option, as it's no longer required -- users are ALWAYS able to manually change the encoding of shapefiles layers if needed Always show users the detected embedded encoding in the layer properties, instead of always showing \u0026quot;UTF-8\u0026quot; when the embedded encoding information is used This should give the best of both worlds -- a nice default behavior resulting in shapefiles being read with the correct encoding, whilst still allowing users to override this on a layer-by-layer basis as needed.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Oracle curve type edition support ¶ In earlier versions of QGIS, it was not possible to edit some geometry types coming from an Oracle database. We have then added edition support for the following geometry types:\nCircularString(Z) CompoundCurve(Z) MultiCurve(Z) CurvePolygon(Z) MultiSurface(Z) This feature was funded by Lille Metropole\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces (Oslandia)\nFeature: MBTiles raster support in WMS provider ¶ This feature adds MBTiles tiled raster map support to WMS provider so that it uses the same code paths like WMTS or XYZ tiles. Here are the advantages of the approach through WMS provider:\ncorrectly scaling tiles on high dpi display better look when not zoomed to the native resolution of the tiles. WMS provider uses smooth scaling while GDAL uses nearest neighbor by default. map tile showing up while rendering (with GDAL it's blank map until everything is loaded) possible to use tile scale slider dock widget faster - mainly a side effect of loading fewer tiles on high dpi display This feature was developed by Martin Dobias\nFeature: Native PostGIS raster data provider ¶ This is an implementation of a PostGIS raster data provider in QGIS core. Tiles are cached in RAM memory.\nThis feature was funded by Christmas Holidays Inc.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Show dimensions metadata on WMS layer metadata ¶ This feature was developed by Samweli Mwakisambwe\nFeature: Other average methods 3d mesh ¶ QGIS now includes numerous methods for averaging mesh layers (see related QEP, and for a description of the methods see TUFLOW documentation.\nSingleLevelAverageMethod (top) SingleLevelAverageMethod (bottom) MultiLevelsFromTopAveragingMethod MultiLevelsFromBottomAveragingMethod SigmaAveragingMethod DepthAveragingMethod HeightAveragingMethod ElevationAveragingMethod This feature was developed by Peter Petrik\nFeature: OGC API - Features provider ¶ This new provider is a client-side implementation of the recently adopted OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core specification, previously known as WFS3. It is integrated within the graphical user interface of the WFS provider, and leverages its core mechanisms to offer background downloading of features, using paging, and a local cache of already downloaded features for a smoother interactive use of datasets.\nThis feature was funded by Planet\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault (Spatialys)\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: QGIS Development Server Application ¶ QGIS Development HTTP Server\nThis is a small independent command-line application that implements a minimal HTTP development server for QGIS Server.\nIt can be useful when developing and testing QGIS Server projects, modules, and plugins without requiring a full webserver/FCGI stack.\nUsage: qgis\\_mapserver [options] [address:port] QGIS Development Server Options: -h, --help Displays this help. -v, --version Displays version information. -l Sets log level (default: 0) 0: INFO 1: WARNING 2: CRITICAL -p Path to a QGIS project file (*.qgs or* .qgz), if specified it will override the query string MAP argument and the QGIS\\_PROJECT\\_FILE environment variable Arguments: addressAndPort Listen to address and port (default: \u0026#34;localhost:8000\u0026#34;) address and port can also be specified with the environment variables QGIS\\_SERVER\\_ADDRESS and QGIS\\_SERVER\\_PORT Sample output:\nbash QGIS Development Server listening on http://localhost:8000 CTRL+C to exit 127.0.0.1 [lun gen 20 15:16:41 2020] 5140 103ms \u0026quot;GET /wfs3/?MAP=/home/ale/dev/QGIS/tests/testdata/qgis_server/test_project.qgs HTTP/1.1\u0026quot; 200 127.0.0.1 [lun gen 20 15:16:41 2020] 3298 2ms \u0026quot;GET /wfs3/static/jsonFormatter.min.js HTTP/1.1\u0026quot; 200 127.0.0.1 [lun gen 20 15:16:41 2020] 1678 3ms \u0026quot;GET /wfs3/static/jsonFormatter.min.css HTTP/1.1\u0026quot; 200 127.0.0.1 [lun gen 20 15:16:41 2020] 1310 5ms \u0026quot;GET /wfs3/static/style.css HTTP/1.1\u0026quot; 200 127.0.0.1 [lun gen 20 15:16:43 2020] 4285 13ms \u0026quot;GET /wfs3/collections?MAP=/home/ale/dev/QGIS/tests/testdata/qgis_server/test_project.qgs HTTP/1.1\u0026quot; 200\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Add DXF server export params NO_MTEXT and FORCE_2D ¶ QGIS server now supports the new parameters NO_MTEXT and FORCE_2D to control text and line symbology for generated DXF files. Adds missing parameters to GetDxf request\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Add json support to WMS GetLegendGraphic ¶ This feature adds support for GetLegendGraphic responses encoded as JSON. It builds on previous work by @pblottiere, who added QgsLegendRenderer::exportLegendToJson for that exact purpose.\nFor example a GetLegendGraphic request with FORMAT=image/png producing the image\nwill produce the following with FORMAT=application/json\nThe icon image is encoded in base64, and directly displayable in a web page.\nThis feature was developed by Éric Lemoine\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Exposes shape digitizing methods to QgisInterface ¶ The actions to trigger the drawing tools were not exposed in the API, if you wanted to do an action for one of these tools, you had to recreate classes. So a call of the type qgis.utils.iface.actionCircleCenterPoint().trigger() simplifies programmability.\nThis feature was funded by QWAT/QGEP group\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti (Oslandia)\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Stephen Knox ¶ Bug Title URL issues (if reported) URL PR or commit Allow editing of postgres JSON fields from Text Edit Widget #29361 #30758 This feature was developed by Stephen Knox\nFeature: Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.10 backport commit (GitHub) \u0026quot;Recent\u0026quot;

This means that all animation frames will have the same start date-time but different end dates and times.\nThis is useful is you wish to accumulate data in your temporal visualisation instead of showing a 'moving time window' across your data.\nThis feature was funded by Meteorological Service of Canada\nThis feature was developed by Kartoza / Samweli Mwakisambwe\nFeature: Add a new \u0026quot;Redraw Layer Only\u0026quot; mode for temporal vector layers ¶ When set to this mode, the layer will automatically be redrawn whenever the temporal range is changed, but no time based filtering will be applied to the features.\nThis configuration is useful when the layer has symbology settings which vary based on the temporal range. For instance, when a layer is using time-dependent rule-based renderer expressions or data-defined symbology expressions.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add basic temporal handling support for vector layers ¶ This exposes some basic native temporal capabilities for vector layers:\nStatic time range for layer (to match raster layer possibilities), this sets a single static time range that applies to the whole layer. All features from the layer will be shown whenever the canvas time overlaps the layer time range \u0026quot;Single field with DateTime\u0026quot;: Allows selection of a single Date or DateTime field from the layer. Features will be shown whenever this field value is within the canvas time range \u0026quot;Separate Fields for Start and End Date/Time\u0026quot;: Allows selection of start and end Date/DateTime fields from the layer. Features will be shown whenever the time interval calculated from these fields overlaps the canvas time range We should consider extending this in future, e.g. to add modes like \u0026quot;start time + fixed duration\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;start time + duration from field\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;start and end time via expressions\u0026quot;, etc.\nSome known limitations/inefficiencies:\nCurrently only Date/DateTime fields can be used. This was done to simplify the format handling and avoid the need to worry about string fields with different DateTime formats. In future, we should allow selection of string fields and allow users to enter a custom DateTime format string Unlike the Time Manager plugin approach, the approach taken here is to rely completely on QGIS expressions and feature requests to do the filtering (Time Manager uses layer filter strings and attempts to set a native SQL filter syntax so that filtering is done on the backend). This is intentional because it provides a unified filter approach regardless of the provider used (i.e. we don't need to worry about the different SQL syntaxes used natively by the different providers). The beauty of feature request expression compilation should mean that the QGIS expressions are magically turned into native backend queries, BUUUUUUUUUUUT... because we lack QGIS expression support for DateTime literals, we currently rely on the \u0026quot;to_datetime\u0026quot; expression function and coerce everything through strings. None of the expression compilers handle this function, so currently *all* filtering is done on the QGIS side. We need to add functions for optimised DateTime literal creation and then ensure that the different compilers correctly map these literals across to the backend filter syntax to allow all the filtering work to be done on the database side... So, currently, performance is much worse with large layers compared to Time Manager (and the exposed feature set is smaller, e.g. no interpolation handling) but the advantage is that we can use the native temporal framework and have vector layers animated alongside mesh and raster layers!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Postgres raster temporal API support ¶ Added temporal capabilities integration for Postgres rasters.\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: QGIS Project temporal settings ¶ This feature adds project time settings functionality.\nYou will be able to set the project temporal range either by using manual input or by calculating it from the current project's temporal layers. The latter can be done by clicking the provided \u0026quot;Calculate from Layers\u0026quot; button.\nThis implementation sets the stage for adding an animation feature for temporal layers in QGIS.\nHere's an example of setting the project temporal range. Prior discussions about QGIS temporal support can be found here and here.\nThis feature was funded by Meteorological Service of Canada\nThis feature was developed by Kartoza / Samweli Mwakisambwe\nFeature: WMS-T layers temporal constraints support ¶ This feature adds the ability to constrain WMS Temporal (WMS-T) layers inside QGIS. You will be able to constrain the DateTime range for any temporal layer from WMS-T providers.\nThis implementation lets the user specify the required DateTime range on the layer from the source tab on the layer properties dialog.\nBelow is an example of the workflow. Note: For instant point in time requests, specifying a range with equal begin and end DateTime will result into using the specified DateTime instant and not a range.\nThis feature was funded by Meteorological Service of Canada\nThis feature was developed by Kartoza / Samweli Mwakisambwe\nFeature: Temporal API ¶ This feature provides an API implementation for temporal support in QGIS.\nYou can find the API for Python by searching for 'Temporal' in the python docs (link).\nThis feature was funded by Meteorological Service of Canada\nThis feature was developed by Kartoza / Samweli Mwakisambwe\nMap Tools ¶ Feature: Identify Tool Support for QGIS vector tile layers. ¶ The identify map tool is now able to inspect attributes of features in vector tiles.\nThis feature was funded by Many funders\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Martin Dobias)\nFeature: Show a menu next to scale widget buttons, to allow setting the widget directly to a scale from a print layout map ¶ A screencast says a thousand words:\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add tool button to \u0026quot;Deselect Features from the Current Active layer\u0026quot; ¶ This feature was developed by Ivan Ivanov\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Allow the drag and drop of a layer across several QGIS instances ¶ This feature was funded by QGIS Swiss user group\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Open attribute tables as tabs ¶ If the option \u0026quot;Open new attribute tables as dock windows\u0026quot; is active, new attribute tables will be opened as tabs on top of existing attribute tables.\nThis feature was developed by Germán Carrillo\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Raster Layer Contour Renderer ¶ This new renderer draws contour lines that are calculated on the fly from the source raster band. It is possible to set the interval of the contour lines and the symbol used for drawing.\nIn addition there is support for \u0026quot;index contours\u0026quot; - contour lines with higher intervals, typically drawn with a wider line symbol.\nIf we generate contour lines on input raster blocks with the same size as our output raster block, the generated lines would contain too much detail. This detail can be reduced by the \u0026quot;downscale\u0026quot; factor - this will request lower resolution of the source raster.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias\nFeature: Add percentage size unit for Raster Image Marker and Raster fill layers symbology. ¶ According to the Feature Request this patch adds a new percentage (of original image size) value for size units of Raster Image Marker and Raster fill (by nirvn suggestion) layers.\nFor example a layer contains raster images of various sizes and aspect ratios:\nIf we use an existing Raster image marker size unit values the layer will look like this (with a normal croc, but huge giraffe):\nor like this (with a normal giraffe but tiny croc):\nThe new percentage value of size units is intended to fix this issue.\nBoth unit tests \u0026quot;qgis_rasterfilltest\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;qgis_rastermarkertest\u0026quot; were rewritten with a set of new control images for testing the proposed percentage value of size units.\nThis feature was developed by beketata\nFeature: Add data-defined property to font family/style for font markers ¶ Data-defined properties were added for the font markers' font family and the brand new font style properties. This can come in handy for a number of scenarios, including multilingual context where a data-defined property can avoid duplicating datasets.\nThis feature was funded by iMHere Asia\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: New font style setting for font markers ¶ With this brand new font style setting, users can pick non-default style of font families previously not available.\nThis feature was funded by iMHere Asia\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Respect HTML colors in labels ¶ When enabled, this option will treat label contents as HTML, and any FOREGROUND COLOR RELATED html formatting options will be respected in the rendered label.\nNote: ONLY HTML COLOR TAGS ARE RESPECTED. This is NOT a bug, rather this feature has been designed as a \u0026quot;test of the waters\u0026quot; with HTML formatting in labels, and accordingly only formatting options which do not alter the font shape were considered.\nOn the plus side, it works correctly with ALL other label settings, including shadows, buffers, curved labels, etc!\nNow some pretty pictures:\nThis feature was funded by geoProRegio AG\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Automatic placement of labels outside polygons ¶ This feature adds the ability to automatically place labels outside of polygon features.\nThis is exposed in a number of ways:\nA new placement mode which always places polygon labels for the layer outside the features: When using other polygon placement modes, a new checkbox \u0026quot;Allow placing labels outside of polygons\u0026quot; can be checked to allow labels to be placed outside when it isn't possible to place them inside the polygon: The \u0026quot;allow placing labels outside\u0026quot; checkbox can be data defined, allowing users to either allow outside labels, prevent outside labels, or force outside labels on a feature-by-feature basis.\nThe placement algorithm is based on a modification of Rylov \u0026amp; Reimer (2016) \u0026quot;A practical algorithm for the external annotation of area features\u0026quot;. While Rylov \u0026amp; Reimer propose a horizontal sweep-line based approach for selection of candidate label points, in practice I found that this delivered inferior results (and was slower) then just traversing the exterior ring of the polygon and generating candidate point at regular intervals (especially for narrow, nearly horizontal polygons).\nAs shown in the islands screenshot above, the outside placement mode works as expected with the \u0026quot;Follow label placement\u0026quot; multiline alignment mode.\nThis feature was funded by Swiss QGIS user group\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Vector tile layer - part 4 (labeling) ¶ Continued work on vector tile layer implementation.\nThis adds labeling support for vector tile layers. So far this is just working on qgis_core... GUI support will come next. Labeling uses the same concepts as the rendering of vector tiles: we have a list of labeling styles, each one is defined by sub-layer name, geometry type, filter expression, zoom range and of course label style configuration (QgsPalLayerSettings).\nNote there is a \u0026quot;chicken-and-egg problem\u0026quot; with labeling: For vector tiles, we create QgsFields for a sub-layer based on fields that renderer and labeling request, but with labeling it was impossible to get required fields if they were not already available in the expression context (hence some small additions to QgsProperty, QgsPropertyCollection, QgsPalLayerSettings to be able to get required field names by not preparing internal expressions at the same time).\nAn example how to set the above labeling in Python console:\ns = QgsVectorTileBasicLabelingStyle() s.setLayerName(\u0026quot;place\u0026quot;) s.setGeometryType(QgsWkbTypes.PointGeometry) s.setFilterExpression(\u0026quot;rank = 1 AND class = 'country'\u0026quot;) ls=QgsPalLayerSettings() ls.drawLabels=True ls.fieldName=\u0026quot;name\u0026quot; ls.placement = QgsPalLayerSettings.OverPoint s.setLabelSettings(ls) labeling = QgsVectorTileBasicLabeling() labeling.setStyles([s]) iface.activeLayer().setLabeling(labeling) This feature was funded by Many funders\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Martin Dobias)\nFeature: Add control over anchor point for callout on label ¶ This gives users control over where a callout should join to the label text (previously, you only had control over where the callout would join to the corresponding feature geometry).\nChoices include:\nClosest point (previous behavior) Label Centroid Fixed corners: Top left/top right/bottom left/bottom right/etc Data defined control over the label anchor is also possible.\nHelps fix some callout ugliness!\nPrevious result (closest point mode):\nWith new \u0026quot;centroid\u0026quot; placement:\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nMesh ¶ Feature: Use only specified dataset group ¶ This feature allows the user to choose the dataset groups that are used. This can be done in the mesh layer properties dialog in the source tab.\nA new tree view displays all the available dataset groups from the data provider. The dataset groups can be checked/unchecked and renamed.\nThis widget also provides buttons to load extra dataset groups from files, to expand/collapse the tree, to check/uncheck all items and to reset the defaults from the provider (for now, only the original name).\nOnly the checked dataset group will be displayed in the active dataset widget in renderer settings.\nThis feature was funded by Deltares\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Scalar color settings depending on classification ¶ With this feature, MDAL reads classified scalar values in the dataset. When values are classified, the default scalar rendering settings has the color ramp shader and labels set according to the classified values.\nThis feature was funded by Deltares\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Snap on mesh elements ¶ Adds a method to the API to snap on mesh elements.\nThe method returns the position of the snapped point on the closest mesh element :\nFor a vertex, the snapped position is the vertex position For an edge, the snapped position is the projected point on the edge, or the extremity of edge if outside the edge For a face, the snapped position is the centroid of the face The returned position is in map coordinates.\nThis feature was funded by Deltares\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: 1D mesh width/color varying ¶ This feature provides a new way to render a 1D mesh with edge widths that can vary depending on value. So now, width and color vary depending on the value on the edges or on vertices.\nThe user can define min/max value and min/max width to set the rendering.\nFor color, the user can define a color ramp shader (as for 2D mesh and raster).\nFor this new rendering, new generic classes are introduced that could be used outside the mesh framework.\nThis feature was funded by Deltares\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Support for multiple mesh (since MDAL 0.5.91) ¶ In addition to updating to MDAL 0.5.91, this feature allows several meshes to be loaded from one file.\nThe file is parsed and a sub layer dialog is launched using the same logic as for vector or raster layers.\nThis feature was funded by Deltares\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Plug mesh layer to QGIS temporal framework ¶ Time handling in mesh layer ¶ The time in a mesh layer is defined by :\nA reference time provided by the data, the project or the user Each dataset is associated with relative times Time extent is defined by the first time and the last time of all datasets Reference time : AT Dataset 1 time o---RT------RT-----RT-----------RT Dataset 2 time o-------RT------RT--------RT Dataset 3 time o--------------------------RT-------RT------RT Time extent of layer o----\u0026lt;----------------------------------------\u0026gt; - AT : absolute time (QDateTime) - RT : relative time (qint64) The class QgsMeshDataprovidertemporalCapabilities stores the reference time provided by the data and all the relative times of the dataset. This class has the ability to return dataset index from a dataset group index and a relative time since the reference time. The reference time (which can be different than the provider reference time) and the absolute time extent are stored in the class QgsMeshTemporalProperties\nThe temporal settings in the properties widget are only the reference time and the provider time unit: The default reference time of the layer is set by (sorted by priority):\nFrom the data provider if defined in data From the project if defined From current date with time 00h00 The user can change it if he wants.\nRendering principle ¶ The 2D and 3D renderers access the active dataset index from the layer with the time range stored in the QgsContextRenderer and in the Qgs3DMapSettings : Relative time is calculated as the difference between the time range of QgsContextRenderer and the reference time stored by QgsMeshTemporalProperties. The dataset index comes from the QgsMeshDataproviderTemporalCapabilities that maps the relative time with dataset index.\nThe data are brought from the provider with the dataset index.\nStatic dataset ¶ There is also the option to set a static dataset, that is to choose a dataset that will be rendered independently of the QGIS time controller. To do that the user can check the check box at the bottom of the temporal page of the properties widget: For now, as it was simpler to implement and allows the required dataset to be chosen directly, the user can independently choose scalar dataset and vector dataset from combo boxes with the time associated for each dataset (relative time for data without reference time). If required, a unique time could be implemented but that could lead to inconsistent results with non synchronous datasets. The static dataset settings are in the temporal page but can be easily put in the source page if wanted.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Resampling from vertex values to face values ¶ Resampling is available for datasets defined on faces, e.g. the value on vertices is calculated from values on faces.\nThis feature implements resampling from values on vertices to values on faces using the neighbor average method.\nThe default method is set to \u0026quot;none\u0026quot; for resampling from vertices to faces and to \u0026quot;neighbor average\u0026quot; for resampling from faces to vertices. Then the default rendering is always smooth. This feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Coloring mesh vector dataset with color ramp shader ¶ This feature allows the user to color the mesh layer vector dataset (arrow, stream lines, traces) with the color ramp shader depending on the magnitude of the vector.\nThis feature was funded by Deltares\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Save style for mesh layer ¶ This feature adds the option for saving a mesh layer style in a qml file, as utilised for vector and raster layers.\nThe feature also refactors the raster and vector layer properties menu style. This feature was funded by Artelia Group\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Mesh 1D Renderer ¶ Update to MDAL 0.5.90\nInitial implementation of Support of 1D elements in Mesh Layers\n1D Meshes consist of vertices and edges. An edge connects two vertices and can have assigned data (scalars or vectors) on it. The 1D mesh network can, for example, be used for modelling an urban drainage system.\nThere are new options to display 1D mesh (edges) in the mesh frame tab Also for data on 1D mesh (edges or vertices) there are new options in the contours tab\nNote that not all functionality available for 2D meshes is available, notably\nSupport for Mesh Calculator for 1D meshes 3D rendering of 1D meshes Identify and Plots in Crayfish (will be added later in the following PR) Some functions are not necessary for 1D meshes, especially\nExport of mesh contours This feature was developed by Peter Petrik\nFeature: Mesh simplification ¶ As a mesh layer could have millions of triangles, rendering can be very slow, especially as all the triangles are displayed in the view even when triangles are too small to be seen.\nFor those situations, this feature provides an option to simplify the mesh. Simplification leads to one or more simplified meshes that represent levels of detail. When rendering the mesh, the appropriate level of detail is chosen to provide an adequate rendering depending on the view.\nA new tab in the mesh layer properties widget allows the user to change the settings :\nThe reduction factor is used to simplify a mesh; the number of triangles for each level of detail is approximately equal to the number of triangles of the previous level of detail, divided by the reduction factor Maximum mesh resolution: this is the average size (in pixels) of the triangles that are allowed to be displayed; if the average size of the mesh is lower than this value, a mesh with a lower level of detail is displayed, i.e. a mesh with an average size just greater than the maximum mesh resolution. This feature allows the speeding up of rendering as shown in these tables (result in milliseconds) : Demo GIF Before: After: This feature was funded by BMT\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Arrows for 3D mesh layer dataset rendering ¶ This feature adds an option for displaying arrows on a mesh layer dataset 3D entity, depending on vector dataset.\nThe dataset used to render arrows is the one chosen for rendering vectors on 2D rendering.\nIn the same way, the color of arrows are defined in the 2D rendering settings for vector dataset.\nIn 3D settings, the user can define the spacing of arrows and if size is fixed or scaled on magnitude.\nThis spacing setting also defines the maximum size of arrows because arrows can't overlap. This feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Temporal settings for layout map items ¶ This feature adds a collapsible section to the layout map item widget that allows users to enable and set a temporal range to be used when rendering map content.\nThe start and end datetime value can be data-defined, which comes in handy when used alongside atlas features.\nThis feature was funded by iMHere Asia\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Allow sorting attribute table by field not listed in the table ¶ Instead of using the same data model for the displayed and the sorting columns, two data models are now used. They use the same API / base class as they are very similar.\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Expose control over layer legend splitting behavior on a layer-by-layer basis ¶ This allows users to manually override the legend's default setting for \u0026quot;split layers\u0026quot; on a layer-by-layer basis, by double clicking a layer in the layout legend panel and choosing whether that layer:\nFollows the default legend setting for splitting Can ALWAYS be split over multiple columns (regardless of the legend's setting) or\nCan NEVER be split over multiple columns (regardless of the legend's setting) Sponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow customisation of division and subdivision symbols as distinct from scalebar tick horizontal symbol ¶ Allows for styling division and subdivision symbols in a different way compared with the horizontal line symbol in a tick scalebar\nSponsored by SLYR\nBuilds off the hard work done by @agiudiceandrea!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow overriding the default symbol for a legend node ¶ This allows users to (optionally) customise the symbol appearance for a legend node, e.g. to tweak the colors or symbol sizes to better provide a \u0026quot;representative\u0026quot; patch symbol compared with how those corresponding features actually appear on the map.\nIt's useful for exaggerating symbol widths, or for manually tweaking the colors of semi-transparent symbols so that the colors represent the actual appearance of the symbols when rendered on top of the map content. Or to tweak the marker interval/offset in marker lines so that the markers are nicely spaced in the legend patch.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow placing manual column breaks in legends ¶ Adds the option when configuring a legend item to place a column break before the item, causing it to be placed into a new column.\nThis allows user control over the column content, for cases when the automatic column generation doesn't result in the desired results.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add subdivisions in ticks scalebar right segments ¶ Adds the ability to create subdivisions for segments included in the right part of the ticks scalebar.\nLine Ticks Up Line Ticks Middle Line Ticks Down Scalebar item properties - Segments groupbox The behaviour related to the segments on the left side of the scalebar is unchanged.\nThis feature was developed by Andrea Giudiceandrea\nFeature: Allow overriding the legend patch size on a per-item basis ¶ Allows users to override the symbol patch size for individual legend nodes, by double clicking the node\nWidth and height can be individually overridden, with the node falling back to the default width or height when the override isn't set.\nSponsored by SLYR This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow control over the horizontal spacing before legend group/subgroup/symbols ¶ Gives flexibility to allow \u0026quot;nesting\u0026quot; legend groups/subgroups/symbols and much greater control over legend item placement.\nSponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Manage legend patch shapes through style manager ¶ This update finalises the recent legend patch shape customisation work, by adding in support for custom legend patch shapes to style manager!\nNow we just need a really nice set of default patch shapes to ship!!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow configuring legend patch shapes by double-clicking on legend items ¶ Allows users to set custom legend patch shapes for items by entering a WKT string representing the patch geometry.\nSponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Support pasting pictures directly into layouts ¶ Embeds the pasted picture into the layout.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow marker items to sync rotation with maps ¶ This allows creation of north arrows from marker symbols, exposing the same options as exist for picture items acting as north arrows.\nWhen a marker acts as a north arrow, the map rotation is ADDED to any existing marker symbol rotation (e.g. if you have to rotate the triangle marker 90% to get it pointing straight up, it will still work nicely in north arrow mode!)\nSponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New item type for marker symbols ¶ Allows marker symbols to be placed directly on layouts, e.g. for manually placing markers over a map item or for creation of advanced custom legends.\nPreviously you had to hack support for these, e.g. by drawing rectangles using centroid fill symbols. Much nicer to have a dedicated item type for it, allowing more specific customisation options (coming soon!)\nSponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add import content from clipboard for fixed table items ¶ A new import content from clipboard feature has been added to QGIS' table editor to enable quicker layout fixed table item editing and creation.\nThis feature was funded by iMHere Asia\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Add numeric formatter \u0026quot;fraction\u0026quot; style ¶ This style represents decimal numbers as vulgar fractions, e.g. \u0026quot;3/4\u0026quot; instead of 0.75.\nOptions include using Unicode superscript and subscript characters for nicer typography, e.g. ¹⁷/₂₃ (this is the default mode, disabling this option uses the \u0026quot;17/23\u0026quot; format). An option also exists for using dedicated unicode characters for specific fractions (where a unicode character exists), e.g. ½ or ¾.\nUltimately this allows for creation of scalebars with fractional representations of distances, e.g. 0 ----- ½ ----- 1 km (instead of 0 ------ 0.5 ------ 1km)\nSponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add \u0026quot;stepped line\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;hollow\u0026quot; scalebar styles ¶ Adds two new scalebar styles (which are available in ArcMap, but previously impossible to reproduce in QGIS)\nStepped line style:\nHollow (aka \u0026quot;South African\u0026quot;) style:\nSponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow scalebar line style to be set using standard QGIS line symbols ¶ Instead of the previous settings of scalebar line color/width/cap styles, we now expose the option as a full line symbol for more advanced styling.\nAlso some code cleanups.\nSponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Rework picture item UI and behavior ¶ Adds an explicit choice between SVG or raster image sources, which allows us to clean up the configuration panel for layout pictures by hiding options which don't apply to a certain picture source. Also permits us to:\nReuse the standard SVG selector tree widget, which loads images in a background thread Uses the standard SVG and image selector line edit, which permits drag and drop of images and exposes options to embed images and link to online sources Ultimately this is motivated by a desire to allow users to embed images in layouts and layout templates\nSponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Make CRS controlable by a variable ¶ This makes the Map CRS controllable by a variable.\nRelated to #34547\nThis feature was developed by Alex\nExpressions ¶ Feature: New expressions ¶ ascii make_interval Allows direct construction of interval values from years/months/weeks/days/hours/minutes/second values, without having to construct a string representation of the interval first maptip layer_property('distance_units') display_expression eval_template make_date make_time make_datetime close_line is_multipart geometry Z and M minimum and maximum @frame_number @frame_rate @frame_duration @map_start_time Start of the map's temporal time range (as a datetime value) @map_end_time End of the map's temporal time range (as a datetime value) @map_interval: Duration of the map's temporal time range (as an interval value) @animation_start_time @animation_end_time This feature was developed by Etienne Trimaille, Jan Caha, Julien Monticolo, Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Feature browser for preview in expression builder ¶ This adds a feature browser to the expression builder so one can browse features to see the result of the expression A new widget is added: QgsFeaturePickerWidget. For the moment, it's a simple combobox (but inherits widget so we can add a map picker button later on). It behaves the same way than the one in the relation reference widget (an editable combobox).\nIt relies on the same base model (QgsFeatureFilterModel). A new abstract class QgsFeaturePickerModelBase regroups the logic of the, and the new model is called QgsFeaturePickerModel. Basically the QgsFeaturePickerModel used the feature id to identify the features while QgsFeatureFilterModel use a list of attributes (the foreign keys of a relation). It declutters a bit the former model which was quite...cluttered.\nAs a side note, I tried to use templates for QgsFeaturePickerModelBase, but since templates cannot be mixed with Q_OBJECT, the alternatives sounded like the code would be less readable.\nTests have been added.\nSponsored by the QGIS Swiss User Group!\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Ability to remove custom functions ¶ Adds a remove button to the Functions Editor tab in the Expression builder dialog to allow the removal of user functions from QGIS without needing to navigate to the user profile directory.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Add ability to edit, import and export user expressions ¶ A new button is added that allows editing of saved expressions. It is only active when a user expression is selected in the expressions tree. When pressed, it opens a window that allows the currently selected user expression to be edited. Changing the label of the expression makes a copy of the currently existing one. Demo\nImport/Export\nA new button with a menu is added, that allows the import/export of user expressions to/from a JSON file. Clicking on either of the menu entries opens a file selector dialog for the expressions JSON file source/destination. In the case of label conflicts, an additional dialog asks how to proceed - either to overwrite or to skip the current expression. Import/Export Demo\nThis feature was developed by Ivan Ivanov\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Dedicated avoid geometry intersection/overlap mode ¶ This version of QGIS comes with a new dedicated avoid geometry intersection/overlap mode setting when digitizing features.\n| The three available modes are:\n|\nAllow intersections/overlaps\n|\nAvoid intersections/overlaps on active layer\n|\nAvoid intersections/overlaps on user-defined layers list.\n|\nThe third mode's layers list is setup by the user via the advanced snapping configuration widgets.\nThis feature was funded by OpenGIS.ch\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: New snapping modes: Centroid and middle of a segment (midpoint) ¶ This feature is aimed at improving snapping modes in QGIS by getting closer to the experience of CAD tools.\nIt adds two new modes. Snapping on the center of a geometry (centroid) and the middle of a segment.\nTo allow the selection of these new modes, several snapping modes can be selected at the same time.\nThe order of preference for snapping is as follows: - Vertex, Intersection - Middle - Centroid - Edge - Area\nSponsored by: Qwat group / Ville de Lausanne ( @ponceta @dsavary ) / Oslandia and some spare time\nThis feature was developed by lbartoletti\nFeature: Snapping to the currently digitized feature ¶ Snapping can now also supports snapping to the feature currently being digitised. This option is enabled/disabled a new button in the snapping toolbar.\nThis enables some really nice CAD-like editing abilities, such as closing features at a 90° angle or precisely aligning segments inside a feature. It's very efficient once one is accustomed to using the alt+a shortcut to lock the angle.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn and Land Vorarlberg\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang\nFeature: Tracing now supports curved geometries ¶ The tracing tool now creates curved geometries when working on a layer that supports curved geometries.\nThe support is still experimental, so this feature must be enabled in the digitizing options.\nThis feature was funded by ecoptima and Planteam\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang (OPENGIS.ch)\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Allow editing of links in file widget ¶ In a form, links can now be edited in the file widget (when the widget is not readonly).\nSponsored by the QGIS Swiss user group\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Expression controlled labels (aliases) ¶ This new feature allows form labels (aliases) to be evaluated in the form context.\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Add description to value relation widget ¶ Adds an option for adding a description to each value in a value relation widget. The description will show up as tooltip\nPlease excuse the different languages in the demo video.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: New database table name widget ¶ A new widget was added to QGIS to select a new table from an existing DB connection:\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Get current parent form values in child forms ¶ This feature adds the option of using current values from the \u0026quot;parent\u0026quot; form in filter expressions (for now only in value-relation widgets: to be used in drill-down filters).\nA new \u0026quot;parentForm\u0026quot; scope was added as well as a new set of functions and variables to access the parent from within an embedded child form. The new functions and variables were modelled on the existing \u0026quot;current_value\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;current_feature\u0026quot; etc.\nThe new functions and variables are also available when the parent form is opened from a new (unsaved, unbuffered) feature, making it easier to create drill-down filters based on the parent's values when adding children from an unsaved parent form.\nExample ¶ New functions and variables ¶ Funded by: ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Relation widget: add checkbox to hide save child edits button ¶ This is very useful for embedded forms.\nFunded by: ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Relation widget force suppress popup ¶ Adds an option to the relation widget configuration to suppress form popup open when new features are added in an embedded form context.\nThis option overrides the form-level option (that might still be the desired behavior when the form is used as a standalone form).\nNote: the final label is Force hide form on add feature\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: Added move to bottom in layertreeview context menu ¶ Moving around layers on big projects was made easier with Move to top but one still had to manually move basemaps to the bottom of the layer list, a cumbersome task in big layer trees. This feature adds a Move to bottom option to the layer tree context menu that works in the same way as Move to top.\nThis feature was developed by uclaros\nFeature: Make Add Group button act as Group Selected if selected layers \u0026gt;= 2 ¶ When there is more than one layer selected and the user presses the Add Group button, create a new group and put the selected layers in it too! This feature was developed by uclaros\nFeature: Allow renaming of the current map theme ¶ This adds the option of renaming a map theme from the map theme drop-down menu.\nThis feature was developed by Harrissou Sant-anna\nFeature: Turn on/off ALL selected layers with \u0026quot;Space\u0026quot; button ¶ Toggles the visibility of the currently selected layers or groups using the space button: This feature was developed by Ivan Ivanov\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: Network logger - more functionality ¶ Adds some more useful tools to the network logger:\nCopy URL Copy request as JSON Save log to file (after a big warning to users that the log may contain sensitive information and should be treated as confidential) This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Inbuilt network logging tool ¶ This tool, which is available from the new F12 \u0026quot;dev tools\u0026quot; panel, is a native port of @rduivenvoorde's network logger plugin.\nIt shows a list of ongoing and completed network requests, along with a whole load of useful detail like request and reply status, headers, errors, SSL configuration errors, timeouts, cache status, etc.\nAlso has loads of polish and useful capabilities, such as the ability to filter requests by URL substrings and status, and you can right-click requests to open the URL in a browser or copy them as a cURL command.\nWhy do we want this as a native tool instead of a plugin? Well:\nIt's extremely useful, so is nice to have available out-of-the-box By moving it to c++, we can startup the logging process much earlier than a plugin gets the opportunity to. This allows the log to include additional information, such as requests fired off by other plugins which occur before the network logger plugin has been loaded (also other in-built requests, e.g. news feed) Performance has been an ongoing struggle with the Python plugin. While this is about as close as a 1:1 port as you can get, the performance issues have all been magically solved. The classes have some very intensive list operations, which is likely the cause of the poor performance under Python. This feature was funded by Meteorological Service of Canada\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (for Kartoza)\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Collection of random raster generation algorithms ¶ With this feature we added a large collection of random number raster generation algorithms. The algorithms are capable of outputting random rasters following specific random number distributions. The following distributions are available:\nCreate random raster layer (binomial distribution) Create random raster layer (exponential distribution) Create random raster layer (gamma distribution) Create random raster layer (negative binomial distribution) Create random raster layer (normal distribution) Create random raster layer (poisson distribution) Create random raster layer (uniform distribution) This feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Vector tile layer - part 8 (writer in Processing) ¶ This feature adds Processing integration for vector tile writing. It is just a wrapper around the existing QgsVectorTileWriter class.\nNew algorithms in the Processing toolbox:\nAlgorithm's parameters for XYZ:\nAlgorithm's parameters for MBTiles:\nList of input layers:\nInput layer details:\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Community\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Martin Dobias)\nFeature: New modeler algorithm for creating conditional branches ¶ This algorithm allows users to setup multiple conditions (via qgis expressions), which cause their corresponding branch of the model to be run or skipped depending on the result of the expression evaluation.\nThis feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow reordering model inputs ¶ Instead of forcing a quasi-random ordering of inputs for models, this feature exposes a new \u0026quot;Reorder Model Inputs\u0026quot; option in the model designer which allows users control over the exact order of inputs to show users for their model.\nNo more illogical ordering like showing a field choice before the layer choice it's based on!\nSponsored by NaturalGIS\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Defer model validation ¶ Instead of forcing all child algorithms to be immediately valid and have all parameters correctly filled, this feature defers model validation until run time or when a new \u0026quot;Validate model\u0026quot; action is triggered.\nA common frustration with the QGIS model designer is that it constantly forces models to be valid, even work-in-progress models. This means it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to add a component to a model and only partially populate its settings \u0026mdash; you have to fill in everything upfront. If you realise mid way through this that you need to make a change somewhere else in your model, it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to do without canceling and losing all the settings you\u0026rsquo;ve already configured.\nThis change sees the model validation deferred until run time. Models can be temporarily invalid (e.g. having algorithm components which are only partially configured). The missing required values can now be filled at a later stage, without losing any existing settings. If a non-valid model is run, the user gets a descriptive warning informing them of the changes they need to make in order to finish configuration of the model.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Added support for different raster data types in Create constant raster layer algorithm ¶ With this feature we added a new advanced OUTPUT_TYPE parameter for the Create constant raster layer algorithm. Via this parameter, you can now specify an output data type for your constant raster layers.\nByte Integer16 Unsigned Integer16 Integer32 Unsigned Integer32 Float32 Float64 This feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Added Round raster algorithm ¶ With this new processing algorithm we enable QGIS to round Raster values.\nThe main functionality of the algorithm is either standard up/nearest/down-rounding of floating point cell values or rounding to powers of a user specified base n. The algorithm can be used with rasters of all types (even byte/integer rasters when rounding to powers of n) and outputs the same raster data type. A standard floating point rounding of an integer raster will copy it and raise a warning.\nThe example shows an output raster rounded to multiples of 10\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Allow copying/cut/paste of model components ¶ This feature allows users to copy and paste model components, both within the same model and between different models\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow appending processing results to existing layers ¶ When appending results, users are given a field mapping panel choice to allow them to manually set how fields are mapped to the destination layer's fields:\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow creation of group boxes in models ¶ Adds the following functions to the model designer:\nThe ability to customise the color of individual comments in a model Allow creation of \u0026quot;Group Boxes\u0026quot; in models, which are a visual indicator of logically linked model components (e.g. 'Data Preparation Steps', 'NDVI Calculation Steps', ... etc). Users can customise the color and title for group boxes. Allow navigation direct to group boxes from the View menu, aiding navigation of complex models. Refs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Processing: show input and output values for children after running model through designer ¶ A picture explains this best! After running the algorithm through the designer, you now see the values calculated for the inputs and outputs for each child algorithm:\nThis is very useful for debugging models -- you can see a much clearer visual picture of the flow of values through the model.\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add \u0026quot;Save Log to File\u0026quot; algorithm for models ¶ This algorithm saves the contents of the execution log (right up to the point in the model at which the 'save log' algorithm executes) to a file.\nIt can be used to automatically store the debugging log when running models for later reference and transparency.\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow running algorithms directly on database (and other non-disk) sources without loading into projects first ¶ This change allows users to directly browse to non disk-based layer sources for any processing feature source inputs. It allows these inputs to be taken direct from postgres, sql server, oracle, wfs, afs, etc layers directly without having to first load them into a project!\nWe take full advantage of the QGIS browser to enable this:\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Expose per-feature-source advanced options for processing inputs ¶ This feature exposes per-feature-source advanced options, such as:\nThe ability to limit the number of features read from the source. (Useful in model development, you can easily test run models using a small subset of an input layer) The ability to override on a per-input basis the global processing option for how to handle invalid geometries. Now you can safely leave the default processing setting at the conservative \u0026quot;Stop algorithm execution when a geometry is invalid\u0026quot; setting while easily temporarily overriding this for one particular input! Refs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Enable snapping to grid for models in designer ¶ This update implements two \u0026quot;snapping\u0026quot; features in the Processing model designer:\nUsers can enable a new \u0026quot;Enable Snapping\u0026quot; option from the view menu, which will cause all component moving or resizing operations to automatically snap to grids After selecting some components, users can select Edit -\u0026gt; Snap Selected Components to Grid to manually snap just those selected components. Additionally, I've added a helpful \u0026quot;select all\u0026quot; action for quickly selecting all components in a model.\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add \u0026quot;filter by geometry type\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;filter by layer type\u0026quot; algorithms to processing ¶ This update adds two new algorithms to processing:\n\u0026quot;Filter by geometry type\u0026quot;: This algorithm filters features by their geometry type. Incoming features will be directed to different outputs based on whether they have a point, line or polygon geometry. It allows for model creation which responds to different input layer geometry types by applying different logic depending on the input geometry type. \u0026quot;Filter by layer type\u0026quot;: This algorithm allows conditional model branching based on an input layer type. For instance, it allows a model to adapt to the actual layer type of a generic \u0026quot;map layer\u0026quot; parameter input, and decide which branch of the model to run as a result. It also adds in the required API to allow algorithms to \u0026quot;prune\u0026quot; model branches based on their calculated results. For example, a model which returns the new FlagPruneModelBranchesBasedOnAlgorithmResults flag will cause any remaining parts of the model which are dependent on the outputs of that algorithm to be entirely skipped IF the algorithm does not return that particular output. (This is a prerequisite component for a future generic \u0026quot;conditional branching by expression\u0026quot; algorithm, and also used by \u0026quot;filter by layer type\u0026quot; to control the model flow based on the input layer type)\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: \u0026quot;Remove Null Geometries\u0026quot; algorithm can also remove EMPTY geometries ¶ Empty geometries do not contain coordinates. Thus, like null geometries, empty geometries are not spatial data in a strict sense. To make it easier for users to clean a vector layer, the Remove Null Gometries algorithm now has an \u0026quot;Also remove empty geometries\u0026quot; option.\nThis feature was funded by SwissTierras Colombia\nThis feature was developed by Germán Carrillo\nFeature: Add multi-selection handling to model designer, interactive resizing ¶ Adds:\nThe ability to select multiple items at once in the model designer The ability to resize individual or multiple items The ability to delete multiple selected items Improved model designer \u0026quot;tool\u0026quot; interaction, following the layout designer approach (e.g. alt + space = zoom drag mode, and selection tools follow their counterparts in layouts so shift+selection adds to selection, ctrl+selection removes, etc) Selected items can be moved by the cursor keys Refs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nHere's how it looks in action (with a particular ugly looking test model I use!)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add undo/redo support to model designer ¶ Makes QGIS more forgiving for users!\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nWorks just like you'd expect:\nNote that we save the whole model definition in the undo stack, not just the affected component changes.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Remember parameter values between model designer runs ¶ When designing a model, users typically will need to run the model many times as they tweak its structure.\nThis change causes the parameters used when running the model from the designer to be remembered and saved into the model, so that each time you run the model from the designer you don't have to re-set all the input parameter values to the desired test ones.\nMakes iterative model design SO much easier!\nSponsored by Alta Ehf\nAlso includes a partial port of the model designer dialog from Python to c++, because c++ \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Python.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Comments in Processing Models ¶ This allows users to create comments attached to model components (inputs, algorithms or outputs). Comments are shown linked to the associated component, and can be freely moved around the model.\nFunded by Fisel + König\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New standalone console tool for running processing algorithms ¶ This new qgis_process tool allows users to run processing algorithms (both built-in, and those provided by plugins) directly from the console.\nRunning:\nqgis_process list will output a complete list of all available algorithms, grouped by provider. qgis_process plugins lists available and activated plugins which advertise the hasProcessingProvider metadata option (only these plugins are loaded by the tool) qgis_process help algid outputs the help and input descriptions for the specified algorithm, e.g. qgis_process help native:centroids qgis_process run: runs an algorithm. Parameters are specified by a --param=value syntax. E.g.\nqgis_process run native:centroids --INPUT=\u0026quot;my_shapefile.shp\u0026quot; --OUTPUT=\u0026quot;centroids.kml\u0026quot; or\nqgis_process run native:buffer --INPUT=/home/me/my.shp --DISTANCE=20 --OUTPUT=/home/me/buffered.shp While running an algorithm a text-based feedback bar is shown, and the operation can be cancelled via CTRL+C\nSponsored by the Swedish User Group\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New parameter type for datetime (or date, or time) values ¶ Adds a new parameter type QgsProcessingParameterDateTime for handling date/datetime/time values.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add algorithms for raising warnings and exceptions from models ¶ These algorithms raise either a custom warning in the processing log OR raise an exception which causes the model execution to terminate.\nAn optional condition expression can be specified to control whether or not the warning/exception is raised, allowing logic like \u0026quot;if the output layer from another algorithm contains more than 10 features, then abort the model execution\u0026quot;.\nSponsored by Fisel + König\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add Fill NoData cells algorithm ¶ In the new QGIS version we introduce a new processing algorithm for filling NoData cells in a raster dataset with a constant numerical input.\nThe algorithm scans an input raster dataset for NoData cells and fills them with the user defined fill value. Doing so, the algorithm respects the data type of the input raster so that e.g. floating point numbers will be dealt with appropriately for an integer raster. The resulting dataset will not contain any NoData cells.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Various fixes for Processing ¶ Finalize work on range parameters support in GRASS algorithms; Fix broken r.series algorithm Minor fixes to r.rescale and r.rescale.eq Fix for rasterize tool GRASS GIS tests cleanup This feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Show \u0026quot;template layer\u0026quot; field constraints in the \u0026quot;Refactor Fields\u0026quot; algorithm interface ¶ When you are migrating data, it is important to be aware of constraints on target (a.k.a. template) layers.\nThe \u0026quot;Refactor Fields\u0026quot; algorithm now highlights constraints, and even lets you know more about them via tool-tips.\nThis feature was funded by SwissTierras Colombia\nThis feature was developed by Germán Carrillo\nFeature: New convert to curves algorithm ¶ We added a new algorithm to convert segmentized geometries to curved geometries.\nThe algorithm considers successive points to represent a curve if they are evenly spaced and within a tolerance.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Add @layers, @layer_ids project scope variables ¶ Add @layers, @layer_ids project scope variables which contain lists of map layers and map layers ids for all layers from the current project\nThis mimics the existing @map_layers, @map_layer_ids, but unlike the @map variants these return ALL project layers, not just those associated with the current context's map settings.\nSponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Allow adding attributes in the New Scratch Layer dialog ¶ Allows the user to add attributes directly in the New Scratch Layer dialog making it more consistent with other dialogs like New Shapefile/Geopackage. It is still possible to create a scratch layer without any attributes by not adding any fields to the list.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Allow creating geometryless DBF tables from the New Shapefile dialog ¶ Allow creating \u0026quot;plain\u0026quot; DBF files without associated geometries from the New Shapefile dialog.\nCreating DBF tables can be useful in some cases and having to use third-party tools for this instead of doing it from within QGIS is inconvenient. This also makes the New Shapefile dialog more consistent with the New Geopackage dialog, which already allows \u0026quot;geometryless\u0026quot; tables to be created.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Allow filtering WM(T)S list in source dialog ¶ Add ability to filter between lists of WMS or WMTS from the source dialog\nWMS WMTS Sponsored by the QGIS Swiss user group\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Add vector tiles to Datasource manager dialog and Layers menu ¶ Adds a new tab to the Datasource Manager dialog allowing the user to manage/add vector tile connections, including import/export. Also adds a corresponding entry to Layers menu.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Import/export for ArcGIS Map and FeatureServer connections ¶ Add missed import/export functionality for ArcGIS MapServer and FeatureServer connections.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Add XYZ tiles to Datasource manager dialog and Layers menu ¶ Adds new tab to Datasource Manager dialog allowing to manage/add XYZ connections. Also add corresponding entry to Layers menu.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Spatialite transaction group ¶ Transactions implementation for the native SpatiaLite provider.\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Allowing saving outputs direct to more database formats (and other nice stuff) ¶ This update allows users to save processing vector outputs directly to more database formats.\nPreviously outputs could only be written directly to postgres databases. With this change, this functionality has been made more flexible and now supports direct writing to any database provider which implements the connections API (currently postgres, geopackage, spatialite and sql server)\nUltimately this exposes the new ability to directly save outputs to SQL Server or Spatialite databases (alongside the previous GPKG+Postgres options which already existed)\n(As soon as oracle, db2, ... have the connections API implemented we'll instantly gain direct write support for those too!)\nWe do this via a nice inline version of the new \u0026quot;new database table name\u0026quot; widget.\nOther nice stuff includes:\nYou can now drag and drop file or folders from explorer or the qgis browser to output parameters in order to easily overwrite these files (or save to the folder), matching the behavior possible with inputs You can actually write scripts which output direct to ANY qgis data provider (including oracle and db2)... it's just that these don't get exposed in the UI because they don't yet support the connections API Refs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add dedicated parameter type for database connections ¶ Allows selection from the registered database connections for a specific database provider type (the provider must implement the connections API).\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: PG: expose foreign tables ¶ Expose foreign tables to the browser and data source select dialog.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: PG raster expose set filter to app ¶ This should be the final change to the PG raster data provider and exposes the set filter options:\nFilter can be set in the data source dialog (as for vector layers) Filter can be set from the legend tree's context menu (as for vector layers) The renderer, the extent and the min/max stats are also updated when the filter changes New tests for the new behavior This feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Postgres: save features into tables with generated fields ¶ Allow updating/inserting features in PostgreSQL tables with generated fields. GENERATED columns is a feature introduced by PostgreSQL 12, which allows column values to be generated from other columns in the same table; this replaces the creation of triggers to, for instance, automatically populate and keep up-to-date a column of centroids or areas for the polygons in the main geometry column.\nThis feature was developed by José de Paula Rodrigues N. Assis\nFeature: Date and DateTime field types support added to Spatialite and Delimited Text providers ¶ The Spatialite and Delimited Text providers now support Date and DateTime field types.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Add QGIS_SERVER_IGNORE_BAD_LAYERS config option ¶ Allows the overriding of the default behavior in the case of bad layers (which is to invalidate the whole project).\nWhen set to TRUE, bad layers are skipped and the remainder of the project becomes available.\nThis feature was funded by Geoinformatikbüro Dassau GmbH\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Server project settings, add 'expanded' attribute ¶ In addition to the 'visible' and 'mutuallyExclusive' attribute, this update adds 'expanded' to the GetProjectSettings response of the server. The update allows a web client to see which layer tree elements are expanded / collapsed and to then present them the same way in the web map layer list.\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nFeature: Add DXF server export params NO_MTEXT and FORCE_2D ¶ QGIS server now supports the new parameters NO_MTEXT and FORCE_2D to control text and line symbology for generated DXF files.\nAdds missing parameters to GetDxf request.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: WMS project validator ¶ The QGIS Server validator has been reviewed. This tool is useful when you want to publish a QGIS project using the WMS protocol.\nFor programmers, the validator is also now callable from PyQGIS, so plugins can now use it too.\nThis feature was funded by 3Liz\nThis feature was developed by Etienne Trimaille\nFeature: Webp ¶ WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. WebP creates smaller, richer images that make the web faster.\nWebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG images at equivalent SSIM quality index.\nSource: https://developers.google.com/speed/webp\nWith webp QGIS server now supports a format that provides smaller file sizes for the same quality and even provides transparency.\nThis feature was funded by OPENGIS.ch\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Allow plugins to register custom \u0026quot;Project Open\u0026quot; handlers ¶ These allow plugins to extend the \u0026quot;Open Project\u0026quot; dialog by adding in support for new file filters, which appear in the formats drop down list alongside the existing \u0026quot;QGS Projects\u0026quot; entry.\nCustom project open handlers then get first chance at loading project files.\nThis allows plugins to extend QGIS support by adding integrated support for opening projects from non QGS/QGZ formats, e.g. allowing users to open ArcGIS MXD documents or MapInfo WOR Workspaces direct from the project open dialog.\nThese non-native projects are also added to the recent projects list and welcome screen, giving them a truly first-class experience within QGIS.\nSponsored by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow users to install stable or experimental plugins ¶ This update improves the plugin manager by allowing users to choose between installing the stable or the experimental version of a plugin.\nThis makes it possible to have pre-releases of plugins in the repository for power-users to test, while still allowing them to switch back easily to stable versions, without having to untick the global enable experimental option.\nThis change makes no difference for users who haven't checked the enable experimental option.\nThis feature was funded by Swiss QGIS User Group\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Support for adding dock widgets as tabs: addTabifyDockWidget() ¶ Dock widgets are great for displaying complex interfaces that extend QGIS functionality.\nNow, both core and plugin devs have the option to tabify their dock widgets on top of existing ones. They can even choose on top of which dock widget they want their own dock widget appear.\nThis feature was funded by SwissTierras Colombia\nThis feature was developed by Germán Carrillo\nFeature: Port output parameter wrappers to new API ¶ Ports the output parameter wrappers (sinks, vector, raster, file and folder destinations) to the new c++ API for dialog and modeler.\nThis allows a range of new possibilities, including:\nModels with static outputs for child algorithms, e.g. always saving a child algorithm's output to a geopackage or postgres layer Models with expression based output values for child algorithms, e.g. generating an automatic file name based on today's date and saving outputs to that file Refs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Port last remaining input parameters to new API ¶ This update ports the Raster Band input parameter and Multi Layer input parameter to the new C++ API.\nBenefits include:\nExpression based band/layer lists in models Inline (non-blocking) lists for multi selection parameters (fields, bands, layer lists, enums) Rearrangement of inputs for multi-layer parameters in models, to set specific layer orders Refs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Port Feature Source, Raster, Vector and Mesh Layer parameters to new API ¶ It's now possible to use expression-based layer sources in processing models.\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Vector tile layer - part 1 ¶ This is the initial work on vector tile layer support.\n(The red lines are not rendering artifacts, they are drawn intentionally to show tile borders.)\nSummary ¶ So far this only includes changes to the qgis_core library.\nMain additions to the public API:\nQgsVectorTileLayer - the main map layer class QgsVectorTileRenderer - base class for renderer class implementations for vector tiles QgsVectorTileBasicRenderer - default renderer implementation New private classes (may be added to public API if needed):\nQgsVectorTileLoader - handles fetching of tiles from network / mbtiles QgsVectorTileMVTDecoder - handles decoding of raw tile data to features QgsVectorTileLayerRenderer - takes care of overall rendering (fetch + decode + draw) QgsVectorTileUtils - various useful functions Some new classes that may be shared by vector and raster tiles:\nQgsTileXYZ - position of a tile in tile matrix set (zoom level, column, row) QgsTileRange - rectangular selection in a tile matrix (start/end column and row) QgsTileMatrix - description of a tile matrix (map extent, zoom level, scale, number of rows/columns) (also QgsTileMatrixSet to be added later when we support other tile matrix sets than just GoogleCRS84Quad)\nTesting ¶ You can load a vector tile layer from Python console, e.g.:\nds = QgsDataSourceUri() ds.setParam(\u0026quot;type\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;xyz\u0026quot;) ds.setParam(\u0026quot;url\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;https://api.maptiler.com/tiles/v3/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf?key=YOUR_FREE_API_KEY\u0026quot;) uri = bytes(ds.encodedUri()).decode('utf-8') vtl = QgsVectorTileLayer(uri, \u0026quot;Vector Tiles Test\u0026quot;) QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(vtl) It is also possible to load vector tiles from a local MBTiles file - for \u0026quot;type\u0026quot; use \u0026quot;mbtiles\u0026quot; and for \u0026quot;url\u0026quot; use a local path (e.g. \u0026quot;/home/martin/x.mbtiles\u0026quot;).\nThere is currently no support for labeling.\nThanks ¶ Huge thanks to all funders who have contributed to the crowdfunding and made this possible - https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/blog/2020/04/02/vectortiles-donors\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Community\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Martin Dobias)\nFeature: Port processing extent parameter to new api, many other improvements ¶ This update ultimately ports the extent parameter to the new c++ api, but along the way it:\nRefactors the existing gui widget \u0026quot;QgsExtentGroupBox\u0026quot; to move the guts out to \u0026quot;QgsExtentWidget\u0026quot; (allowing it to be used in places where a group box is inappropriate/looks bad). It also adds a new \u0026quot;condensed\u0026quot; mode for the widget, because the default appearance is very space heavy. The new parameter widget utilises this common QgsExtentWidget, so that we remove all the duplicate code which was previously used by the old python wrapper Allows drag and drop of project map layers from the layer tree to a QgsExtentWidget to auto-set the extent to match Allows QgsExtentWidget to be optionally nullable Allows QgsGeometry values to be set for extent parameter values. This is done to aid use of extent parameters with the \u0026quot;precalculated value\u0026quot; mode in models -- you can now use all the expression geometry functions to calculate a geometry and the bounding box of this is used for the parameter value in the child algorithm Refs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Interface and API for unified development/debugging tools ¶ Adds interface hooks to allow plugins (and c++) to register \u0026quot;development/debugging\u0026quot; tools\nThese tools appear in a new Development/Debugging Tools dock, and provide a unified handling and place for these tools in the UI.\nThe intention here is that specialised development/debugging tools will be moved to this common interface, e.g.\nNetwork logger First aid style Python local variables inspector Startup time debugging tools Layer load and rendering time debugging tools ... ? Here's an example demo showing a \u0026quot;Python locals\u0026quot; dev tool:\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Data type support for QgsProcessingParameterMapLayer ¶ Allow the definition of accepted layer types for QgsProcessingParameterMapLayer. This is useful when an algorithm can work with different layer types (for example, points and rasters) and avoids duplication of the same algorithm with different inputs.\nThis is an API improvement and is not visible for the vast majority of users.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Add processing parameter types for database schema and table name ¶ Replaces the previous ad-hoc Python postgis widget wrappers with proper first class c++ dedicated parameters for schemas and tables, with wrappers built off the core connections api.\nRefs NRCan Contract#3000707093\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.10 backport commit (GitHub) Getfeatureinfo does not show relation reference items for QGIS Server #36549 Turned out to be a feature request N/A OGR provider QgsOgrProvider::changeAttributeValues returns true on errors #36583 PR #36620 N/A GPKG transaction groups are stored with empty second pair of the key #36525 PR #36660 PR #37157 Symbology using relations does not propagate in QGIS Server #36614 cannot reproduce N/A \u0026quot;Loading PostGIS raster with QGIS 3.12.3 crashes\u0026quot;

The new long term support release brings a wide range of features to both QGIS Desktop and QGIS Server. This release brings a wealth of new options for 3D mapping, mesh generation from other data types, additional spatial analysis tools, symbology and user interface enhancements to name but a few! A host of tools have been incorporated into the ever-expanding processing framework, and the QGIS browser now supports advanced database interaction functionality that was previously reserved for the DB Manager plugin. These are a few of the improvements that have been introduced from this release, and users of the previous LTS will find a massive number of new features available since 3.10. We are pleased to detail some of the additional highlights of this new release below.\nThanks\nWe would like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and all the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible. From the QGIS community, we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate time, money, or otherwise get involved in making QGIS more awesome, please wander along to QGIS.ORG and lend a hand!\nQGIS is supported by donors and sustaining members.

into the current coordinates window and watch the magic happen.\nThis feature was developed by Germán Carrillo\nTemporal ¶ Ability to export temporal animation frames ¶ Allows exporting of temporal animation frames to successive images, for later stitching together in an external application. Users have precise control over the image size and map extent.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nMap Tools ¶ Go-To locator ¶ We have added a new goto locator filter.\nThe goto indicator takes in the following strings:\nA pair of x and y coordinates (separated by a comma or space). An OSM, Leaflet, or OpenLayers formatted URL. A Google maps URL. The logic of the XY string is as follows:\nIf the canvas CRS isn't WGS84: If the coordinate fits within WGS84 bounds, add a WGS84 result (this is weighted to have higher priority than the canvas CRS result below). If the coordinate fits within the canvas CRS bounds, add a canvas CRS result. If the canvas CRS is WGS84: If the coordinate fits within the WGS84 bounds, add a WGS84 result. This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nUser Interface ¶ Add context menu to map canvas ¶ The map canvas now has a right-click context menu. By default, it creates the \u0026quot;Copy Coordinate\u0026quot; menu that was introduced with QGIS 3.14, however, it is expected that this functionality will be extended to allow many more functionalities to be accessed with spatial context in the future.\nThis feature was developed by jakimowb\nSymbology ¶ Vector tile styling improvements ¶ Multiple enhancements were introduced for the editing of complex vector tiles styles:\nShow tooltips in lists, so that full filter rules and names can be viewed without resizing columns Show the current canvas zoom level in the widgets Allow users to filter the list of styles to only show those which are currently visible Set the correct canvas zoom level when editing symbols, so that expression previews work nicely This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nAllow users to optionally specify the URL for the default style on vector tile connections ¶ When setting up a vector tile source connection, there's a new option to enter a URL to a MapBox GL JSON style configuration. If one has been entered, then that style will be applied whenever the layers from the connection are added to QGIS.\nThis also works also with ArcGIS Vector Tile Service connections which will the default style configuration specified in the server configuration.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nAllow data-defined offset for fill symbol layers ¶ Any fill symbol layer which supports offsetting polygons, including simple fills, raster image fills, shapeburst and gradent fills, now allow data-defined offsets\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nImport MapBox GL JSON styles for vector tile layers ¶ Users can now load MapBox GL JSON style configuration files when importing style files on vector tile layers\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nExpose option to offset simple line dash patterns by a preset amount ¶ Allows for tweaking the positioning of dashes/spaces in the line, so that the dashes/spaces can be placed at nicer positions to account for corners in the line (also can be used potentially to \u0026quot;align\u0026quot; adjacent dash pattern borders).\nThe offset can be set in various units, including map units, and can also be data defined.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nAdd options to dynamically tweak dash pattern in simple line symbol layers ¶ Options have been added to allow the tweaking of dash patterns to allow more control for improving the rendered quality of line symbols. These options include:\nAlign dash pattern to line length: If checked, the dash pattern lengths will be subtly adjusted in order to ensure that when a line is rendered it will end with a complete dash element, instead of a gap element or partial dash element. Tweak dash pattern at sharp corners: If checked, this option dynamically adjusts the dash pattern placement so that sharp corners are represented by a full dash element coming into and out of the sharp corner. It's designed to better represent the underlying geometry while rendering dashed lines, especially for jagged lines. The following images illustrate the \u0026quot;Align dash pattern to line length\u0026quot; change in action, with yellow lines indicating the true start and end position of the line features being symbolised.\nBefore:\nAfter:\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nManage 3D symbols through style manager ¶ Support has been added for managing 3D symbols through the QGIS style manager, including support for importing and exporting libraries of 3d symbols, and completes the recent work in fully abstracting out 3D symbols and their widget handlers.\nUnfortunately, there are no thumbnails generated for 3D symbols in the library, and a generic icon is used for all 3D symbols for the time being. Generating thumbnails is no trivial matter, so it has been deferred for the time being.\nThis feature addresses the issue raised in 31479.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nLabelling ¶ Add option to allow users to control the placement of labels along line features ¶ A new \u0026quot;Label Anchoring\u0026quot; section in the line placement settings for labels allows users to specify whether labels should be placed at the center, start or end of lines. In addition, it allows offsets of these positions (based on the percentage of the feature length), which may be defined statically or by using a data-defined definition.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nControl anchor point for line labels ¶ A new option is exposed which allows users to control whether the anchor point for the labeling of line features is a hint or a strict requirement. The resulting behavior modifications include the following:\nStrict: Labels are placed exactly on the label anchor only, and no other fallback placements are permitted. Hint: The label anchor is treated as a hint for the preferred label placement, but other placements close to the anchor point are permitted. This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nDiagrams ¶ Render axis for stacked bar diagram ¶ This adds support for rendering the axis on stacked bar diagrams if an axis has been set. The implementation is based on the axis rendering for the histogram diagram.\nNegative values are not handled properly by stacked bar diagrams with or without the axis being displayed.\nAddresses Issue 34915\nThis feature was developed by Dan Minor\nMesh ¶ In-memory mesh datasets with persistence ¶ This feature introduces the ability to create in-memory dataset groups for mesh layers. These dataset groups are temporary and are not kept once the project is closed.\nA new option has been added to the mesh calculator which allows the creation of in-memory dataset groups.\nThis feature also introduces the ability to remove or save these memory dataset groups to a file with the specified driver.\nThis feature was funded by Artelia Group\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nMulti identify for mesh layer ¶ The identify tool has been adapted when used on mesh layers and now displays the dataset value corresponding to the current time of the temporal controller for all dataset groups. The active dataset groups (scalar and eventually vector) are first displayed, then the other dataset groups. There is also other information displayed, including:\nSource where the dataset is stored Time step of the dataset that is displayed (can be different than the time of the temporal controller). Displays nothing if the dataset group is not temporal Centroid of the corresponding face Coordinate of the snapped vertex (if one is snapped) Center of the snapped edge (if one is snapped) When the map canvas does not have temporal navigation enabled, the identify results contain only information about the active dataset groups which have static datasets defined in the mesh properties dialog.\nThis feature was funded by Artelia Group\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nVirtual dataset groups for mesh layer ¶ The ability to use \u0026quot;virtual\u0026quot; data set groups has been introduced for mesh layers. This replaces the \u0026quot;memory\u0026quot; dataset group used in 37389.\nWith the mesh calculator, users may choose to create those \u0026quot;virtual\u0026quot; dataset groups that will be added to the layer. Values are not stored in memory but each dataset is rather calculated when needed with the formula entered in the mesh calculator.\nThose virtual dataset groups are saved within the project and be removed or saved to file for persistence.\nPersistent and virtual dataset groups are distinguished in the source tab of the mesh layer properties by changes in the color of the background for each item, indicated as follows:\nPersistent: yellow\nVirtual: purple\nThis feature was funded by Artelia Group\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nAdd export to QgsMesh method ¶ A method has been added to export a triangulation to a QgsMesh instance, with the possibility to construct mesh layer with triangulation from existing points and lines. This is the first step to allow the ability to obtain a QgsMesh from other map layers.\nThe Triangulation and DualEdgeTriangulation classes were also renamed and refactored to make them more consistent with QGIS code.\nAdd a method to export the triangulation to a QgsMesh instance. This feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec\nTIN Mesh creation ¶ TIN mesh layers can be created from vector layer data (vertices and/ or break lines). The resulting mesh is constructed with a constrained Delaunay triangulation. This mesh layer can be created using the python API or through an algorithm in the processing tool box.\nThis feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec\nRendering ¶ Gamma correction filter for raster layers ¶ Add gamma correction filter pipe for raster layers in addition to the existing brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation filters. Users can adjust the gamma value from the layer properties dialog, using styling panel and/or new buttons on the Raster toolbar. Default gamma value is 1.0 and it can be adjusted within the range 0.1 to 10.\nAddresses Issue 13512\nAlso adds a rendering test for brightness and contrast filter which has no test at all and fixes some deprecation warnings in the Python test for QgsRasterLayer.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\n3D Features ¶ Allow 3D material texture files to be embedded in style/project ¶ Some minor API and code cleanups were performed, as well as introducing the use of QgsImageCache for 3D texture files in order to allow them to be embedded within projects.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nShadow rendering ¶ Shadows can now be rendered in 3D views.\nThis feature was developed by Nedjima Belgacem\nExport 3D scenes ¶ 3D Scenes can now be exported for use in other 3D software, such as Blender. This export feature supports multiple additional functions including output model simplification by specifying the output resolution, optional model smoothing, and the exporting of 3D vector layers.\nThis feature was developed by Nedjima Belgacem\nDirectional lighting support for QGIS 3D ¶ Added directional lights to QGIS 3D\nNow the user can add directional lights to the 3D views. I added a tab widget under the lights section of the 3D configuration dialog. The user can specify the direction of the light, its color and intensity. This is just a duplication of the already existing point lights implementation with some changes. Later it may be useful to add a way to visualize the light direction by displaying a mesh that is positioned at camera's view point like an arrow that displays how the sun lights the scene for example. This feature was developed by Nedjima Belgacem\nTexturing support for vector layer ¶ Texturing support has been added for QGIS 3D with the following new functionalities:\nUsers can now select an image to be displayed on the surfaces of buildings as diffuse map from the symbol properties. The user can also change the scale of textures from the symbol properties. Some visual issues may appear when using textures. These issues relate to the normals of surfaces that you may be able to fix by checking \u0026quot;add back faces\u0026quot; and playing around with the invert normals and culling mode in the symbol properties.\nThis feature was developed by Nedjima Belgacem\nEnable embedded and remote 3D models for 3D point symbols ¶ Users can now utilise and embed remote 3D models for 3D point symbols.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nAdd option to show light source origins ¶ A feature which allows users to toggle a visible sphere at light source origins in a 3D scene.\nThis allows for the easier repositioning and placement of light sources relative to the scene contents.\nAddresses Issue #37726.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nImprovements for material handling ¶ Further improvements for material handling were introduced, and a Gooch shading model was added. This improves the QgsAbstractMaterialSettings API, by:\nAdding icon support for registered material types (for use in the material selector combo box). Adds support for handling different rendering techniques to QgsAbstractMaterialSettings. Now material classes can indicate which rendering techniques they support (e.g. Triangles, Lines, InstancedPoints, etc.), and the material is only offered when it's compatible with the required technique. The technique handling in the gooch material widget was improved to avoid showing settings that have no effect in a particular context (e.g. hiding all but the ambient color choice for simple 2D line symbols). A new material, \u0026quot;Gooch\u0026quot;, was added. This material gives a CAD style 3D render, where the shading is not dependent on appropriate lighting setup in a scene and where the 3D details are always visible, regardless of the lighting choice. This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nPrint Layouts ¶ Expose control over text format and alignment for individual cells in manual text tables ¶ Adds control over setting the text format (e.g. bold/italic/buffer/shadow etc) and text alignment (horizontal and vertical) for the contents of individual cells in a manual text table.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nUse QgsTextRenderer to render attribute table text ¶ Allows for the full range of text formatting options in layout attribute tables, including buffers, shadows, word spacing etc.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nUse QgsTextRenderer for drawing map grid text in layouts ¶ Allows for grid annotations which use buffers, shadows, background shapes, etc.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nExpose option to control PDF image compression method when exporting layouts to PDF ¶ Options are for Lossy compression, which is the default JPEG compression used, and Lossless compression (which creates bigger files in most cases, but is much more suitable for professional printing outputs or for post-production in other products such as Illustrator etc)\nThe bad news is that this option is only available in builds based on Qt 5.13 or later.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nAdd automatic clipping settings for atlas maps ¶ This feature allows users to enable map clipping for layout map items so that the maps are clipped to the boundary of the current atlas area feature.\nOptions exist for:\nEnabling or disabling the clipping on a per-map basis Specifying the clipping type: \u0026ldquo;Clip During Render Only\u0026rdquo;: applies a painter based clip, so that portions of vector features which sit outside the atlas feature become invisible \u0026ldquo;Clip Feature Before Render\u0026rdquo;: applies the clip before rendering features, so borders of features which fall partially outside the atlas feature will still be visible on the boundary of the atlas feature \u0026ldquo;Render Intersecting Features Unchanged\u0026rdquo;: just renders all features which intersect the current atlas feature, but without clipping their geometry Controlling whether labels should be forced placed inside the atlas feature, or whether they may be placed outside the feature Restricting the clip to a subset of the layers in the project, so that only some are clipped This feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nAdd API to QgsMapSettings for specifying clipping regions to apply while rendering maps ¶ This is currently API only functionality, but functionality has been added which provide the backend capabilities to specify clipping regions which may be used during map render operations.\nAlthough primarily introduced in order to provide functionality which allows the automatic clipping of map elements to the current atlas feature geometry in print layouts, the API has been deliberately implemented in a manner that's very flexible to allow various use cases which require the clipping of regions during map render operations.\nFor non-vector layers, the clipping is applied through a QPainter clipping path. For vector layers, the API exposes various options in how the clipping should be applied:\nAs an \u0026quot;intersects\u0026quot; style test only: All vector features which intersect the path are rendered, without actually clipping the feature's geometry By modifying the feature's geometry and clipping the geometry to the region: Any stroke or outline settings for the symbol will be rendered along the boundary of the clipping region, even if the feature actually partially falls outside this region. or\nUsing a painter clip path: Features are clipped to the region, but only at painter time. Boundaries of the feature which fall outside the clip region will not be visible. This feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nLayout legend maximum marker size ¶ Adds the possibility to enter the maximum marker size (in mm) to the layout legend widget.\nIn some cases, such as when point layers use a symbol size which is based on map units, the point markers on the layout legend can get quite big. This feature adds a setting to the layout legend widget which allows the restriction of the maximum marker symbol size while the automatic legend update is still active.\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nAllow cells in manual text tables to have expression based contents ¶ Allows individual cells from a manual text table to take their contents from a preset expression. Expressions have access to the full layout item expression context, allowing cells to calculate and display metadata style values or aggregate based calculations.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nClip layout maps to shape ¶ New functionality was introduced which allows users to clip a map item to a shape or polygon item from their layout, allowing for non-rectangular maps within the layout.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nSupport for rotated ticks/annotation ¶ Tick marks and annotations on a map frame in the print composer can now be rotated, allowing them to align with a rotated map frame as described in issue 36904. It works for both rotated maps and reprojected grids.\nThe following options have been added:\nTicks: Rotate ticks (if unchecked, ticks get drawn as before, not taking angle into account) Rotated ticks alignment (whether ticks should have a constant length, or be aligned orthogonaly) Skip low angled ticks (an angle threshold below which ticks aren't drawn, so you can skip ticks for grid lines that are, for example, too close to being parallel with the map edge) Annotations: Parallel to Tick (Next To/ Horizontal / Vertical Ascending / Vertical Descending) Draw low angled (if checked, skipped ticks above will still get an annotation) This feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang, OPENGIS.ch\nAdd page offset expression for Y positions ¶ A layout_pageoffsets expression was added for print layouts which returns an array of Y coordinates for the top of each page in the layout. this allows users to dynamically position items on pages in a context where page sizes may change.\nFor example, to set an item at 2.5mm from the top of page 2 (for the data-defined position Y of a map item) : @layout_pageoffsets[1] + 2.5\nThis constitutes a workaround for Issue 37567.\nThis feature was funded by BikePlan\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang, OPENGIS.ch\nExpressions ¶ Add to_decimal() function to convert DMS to DD ¶ A new QgsCoordinateUtils::dmsToDecimal function has been added which exposes the to_decimal function in expressions. This allows the conversion of DMS (degree/minute/second) strings into DD (decimal degree) format.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nAdd \u0026quot;main_angle\u0026quot; function to return the estimated main angle of a geometry ¶ Returns the angle of the oriented minimum bounding box which covers the geometry value.\nUseful for data defined overrides in the symbology of label expressions, e.g. to rotate labels to match the overall angle of a polygon, and similar for line pattern fill. This feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nPort refFunctions to core ¶ Various overlay operations have been added to the expression engine. This covers the functionality of the refFunctions plugin.\nThe following new expression functions are implemented:\n* overlay_intersects(layer[,expression][,filter][,limit][,cache]) * overlay_contains(layer[,expression][,filter][,limit][,cache]) * overlay_crosses(layer[,expression][,filter][,limit][,cache]) * overlay_equals(layer[,expression][,filter][,limit][,cache]) * overlay_touches(layer[,expression][,filter][,limit][,cache]) * overlay_disjoint(layer[,expression][,filter][,limit][,cache]) * overlay_within(layer[,expression][,filter][,limit][,cache]) * overlay_nearest(layer[,expression][,filter][,limit][,max_distance][,cache]) In all instances, the spatial operator is evaluated against the other layer. If an expression is provided, it returns an array of results. If no expression is provided, it returns a boolean indicating whether or not there is a match for at least one feature. Features can optionally be filtered by an expression, and optionally be limited to a certain count.\nThe overlay_nearest function has an additional max_distance filter.\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang, OPENGIS.ch\nDigitising ¶ Add option to calculate bearing based on travel direction ¶ For devices which report faulty bearing measurements, this option can be used to instead calculate the GPS bearing based on the previous two recorded locations.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nDigitizing and splitting curved features ¶ New functionality was introduced that adds the possibility to switch between linear or circular strings when digitizing or splitting vector layer features.\nThe user can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G to switch between linear/circular.\nFor splitting features, new overloading methods have been added to the API. When splitting, curves are preserved. For this, the curve is segmentized before splitting, and all the split features are \u0026quot;de-segmentized\u0026quot; after splitting.\nA toolbar button was added to enable switching between linear/circular: This feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec\nData Management ¶ Rescale raster algorithm for Processing ¶ Adds a rescale raster algorithm to change raster value range, whilst preserving the shape of the raster's histogram. Useful for when rasters from different sources should be compared or processed together and their pixel values should be in the same range. By default, the algorithm preserves the NODATA value of the input raster but there is an option to override it.\nThe following image displays a histogram of a DEM (value range is 85-243) And the next image displays a histogram of same DEM rescaled to the range 100-1000 Addresses Issue 26099.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nForms and Widgets ¶ Multiple widgets for a single relation ¶ Multiple relation widgets may now be created for a single relation, each with their own distinct configuration.\nThis feature changes the behavior of relation widgets created in the drag and drop interface and provides resolution for Issue 37675.\nOn reading a project configured with older QGIS versions, the config is taken over and written into the new widget configuration. Autogenerated forms no longer allow the configuration of relation editor widgets anymore, but if it has been configured in an older QGIS, the attribute form will still read this configuration.\nThis feature was developed by signedav\nShow related features in identify results tree ¶ Users will now be able to see related (child) features in the results window when using the identify tool. Under each identified parent feature, new groups will show containing any related child features, displaying their attributes, actions, and allowing the user to directly open the feature form for the child feature.\nThis feature addresses issue 18634.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFilter expressions in relation reference widget ¶ An option has been added for static filter expression to be used in the relation reference widget.\nThis feature was developed by Ivan Ivanov\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Add project load profile times to debugging tools dock ¶ Modification of the QgsRuntimeProfiler class which performs the following functions: 1. Make the profiling thread-safe, so that it's possible to record times across multiple threads 2. Allows different profiling \u0026quot;groups\u0026quot;\nThe new groups API is used here to expose a breakdown of project load times in the debugging dock, alongside the existing QGIS startup profiling. It's possible now to get a breakdown of the various stages of project load, in order to identify the causes of slow project load times.\nTODO: In the majority of cases, performance problems will be caused by one or more layers, so it would be nice to further break down the individual layer load times. For example, for an individual WFS layer, we may see the time taken for the initial \u0026quot;server capabilities\u0026quot; or other queries. Add a group with profile times for map rendering, so you can see exactly which layers in your project are causing slow map redraw times.\nIn its current form, only the overall load time of each individual layer is displayed.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nProcessing ¶ Add help string for parameters ¶ Help strings can now be specified at the parameter level.\nThis will be visible in the tooltip, in the CLI and Python Processing API.\nThis feature was developed by Étienne Trimaille\nNew \u0026quot;Align points to features\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ This algorithm calculates the rotation required to align point features with their nearest feature from another reference layer. A new field is added to the output layer which is filled with the angle (in degrees, clockwise) to the nearest reference feature.\nOptionally, the output layer's symbology can be set to automatically use the calculated rotation field to rotate marker symbols.\nIf desired, a maximum distance to use when aligning points can be set to avoid aligning isolated points to distant features.\nAn example use case for this is the aligning of building point symbols to follow the nearest road direction by using a data defined rotation value generated by this algorithm.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nAdd modeler algorithm to create directories ¶ This algorithm allows models to create new file directories. Useful for models which have to output results to certain dynamically created paths (e.g. a folder containing the current date).\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nAdd modeler algorithm to set a project expression variable ¶ Allows a model to set Project-level expression variables during execution. Especially useful with the new Export Print Layout algorithms to allow models which dynamically set variables used in a layout prior to export.\nThis functionality was ported from https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/359386\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nAdd processing algorithms to export a print layout as PDF/image ¶ Models are able to export print layouts from the current project. One use case for this is allowing users to create an in-project model which exports a particular set of layouts from the project to certain folders, so that they can easily re-export the current project in a single operation instead of having to manually open multiple layouts and export one-by-one.\nAdditionally, with the new capabilities to have expression based output files inside models, you can automatically export the layouts to a folder with the current date tag and include this in the exported file names!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nAdd a save features to file algorithm ¶ There is now a native processing algorithm to save vector features to a file dataset within a model. It comes with a pair of advanced features to pass dataset and layer options on to GDAL.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nExport layout atlas as PDF algorithm ¶ A new QGIS processing algorithm was added which allows the export of a map atlas to PDF. This is the PDF counterpart to the recent export atlas layout to image algorithm.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nNew \u0026quot;Flatten Relationship\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ This algorithm flattens all relationships for a vector layer, exporting a single layer containing one master feature per related feature. This master feature contains all the attributes for the related features.\nIt's designed as a quick way to de-normalize a relation from a project, e.g. to allow exporting to CSV.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nExport atlas layout as image algorithm ¶ A new native processing algorithm was added to export layout atlases as images.\nThis is useful in models where remote datasets are processed with the goal of being used as atlas coverage layers.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nNew Cell statistics algorithm ¶ We added a Cell statistics raster analysis algorithm. It performs cell-wise statistics on a stack of raster layers while accounting for NoData. The functions available in the current implementation are:\n|\nSum Mean Median Standard Deviation Variance Maximum Minimum Majority (most frequent value) Minority (least frequent value) Range (max - min) Variety (count of unique values) This feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nNew Equal to frequency algorithm ¶ We have added some new raster algorithms that operate on a local cell-by-cell basis in a raster stack. The Equal to frequency algorithm evaluates on a cell-by-cell basis the frequency (number of times) the values of an input stack of rasters are equal to the value of a value raster.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nNew Greater than frequency algorithm ¶ We have added some new raster algorithms that operate on a local cell-by-cell basis in a raster stack. The Greater than frequency algorithm evaluates on a cell-by-cell basis the frequency (number of times) the values of an input stack of rasters are greater than the value of a value raster.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nNew Less than frequency algorithm ¶ We have added some new raster algorithms that operate on a local cell-by-cell basis in a raster stack. The Less than frequency algorithm evaluates on a cell-by-cell basis the frequency (number of times) the values of an input stack of rasters are less than the value of a value raster.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nNew Lowest position in raster stack algorithm ¶ We added some raster value position analysis tools with this new QGIS version: The Lowest position in raster stack algorithm evaluates on a cell-by-cell basis the position of the raster with the lowest value in a stack of rasters. Position counts start with 1 and range to the total number input rasters. The order of the input rasters is relevant for the algorithm.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nNew Highest position in raster stack algorithm ¶ We added some raster value position analysis tools with this new QGIS version: The Highest position in raster stack algorithm evaluates on a cell-by-cell basis the position of the raster with the highest value in a stack of rasters. Position counts start with 1 and range to the total number input rasters. The order of the input rasters is relevant for the algorithm.\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nLoad processing results to layer group ¶ Users can now optionally set a group name which ensures that the resulting output layers added to the project when using the Open output file after running algorithm option are grouped together. This allows all outputs from several processing algorithms to be grouped so that they may be easily located in the layer tree and be removed, exported, or have their visibility toggled easily. This feature was developed by Germán Carrillo\nAdd zonal statistics algorithm which creates new output ¶ Previously, when calculating zonal statistics, the algorithm always updated the original data source, adding additional fields. A new zonal statistics algorithm has been added which creates a new output instead. This functionality is an implementation of the 29504 feature request.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nAdd geometry processing parameter ¶ Added a new QgisProcessingParameterGeometry for passing geometries as a parameter to processing alogrithms.\nThis provides a way to pass simple geometries to algorithms without requiring an input layer.\nThe immediates use case are:\nAlgorithms that might need to manipulate geometries in an atomic way. Delegation from parent algorithms. Use with headless qgis processing in stand-alone processing tools. Features:\nThe parameter is compatible with string parameters as it may pass Well-Known-Text as the value. The current widget interaction is minimalistic as it only uses the input text widget for entering the value as WKT. This feature was developed by David Marteau\nAdd an interface to determine whether it is safe for the application to exit ¶ An interface for plugins and scripts to register custom logic to prevent the QGIS application from exiting was added. This allows plugins to determine whether it is safe for the application to exit. This has made it possible to allow plugins to determine whether there are unsaved changes which should be saved or discarded before allowing QGIS to exit, functionality which has already been implemented in the console script editor, preventing data loss by prompting users when there are unsaved changes rather than silently shutting down the application.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nApplication and Project Options ¶ List available GDAL vector drivers ¶ A Vector Drivers tab is now available within the QGIS GDAL Settings window, which lists all the available GDAL vector drivers and allows users to toggle their active state. Where several drivers may be used to open data of a specific type, users may now modify these settings to ensure that the intended driver is used when importing specific vector data types. For example, the FileGDB and OpenFileGDB drivers are both capable of being used to import .gdb files, but if the data file has a version of 9.x, the FileGDB won't be able to open it. In this instance, a user may disable the FileGDB driver and ensure that the data is loaded using the OpenFileGDB driver instead.\nThis functionality directly addresses the limitations outlined in Issue 18738.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nDetect GRASS installation folder on MacOS ¶ MacOS previously had a platform-specific custom parameter setting Grass7Utils.GRASS_FOLDER. This caused crashes for many users with multiple QGIS installations or who had some invalid folder settings. The parameter has been removed and a GISBASE environment variable has been introduced instead, which is commonly used in GRASS scripts as the \u0026quot;root\u0026quot; installation directory, emulating the behavior used for GRASS detection in Windows environments. If GISBASE is not present (default), a search is performed for grass folders in QgsApplication.prefixPath() (when packaged in bundle format). If not found, the standalone GRASS instance is searched for. The new behaviour for GRASS is in-line with the methodology used for the GDAL and SAGA processing tools.\nThis resolves Issue 38595.\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Peter Petrik)\nBrowser ¶ Expose fields in the Browser ¶ First part of QEP https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/171\nExposes field columns in the browser for providers that implement connections API:\nPG GPKG Spatialite MSSQL The following operations are supported on fields:\nadd new field delete field This feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nData Providers ¶ ArcGIS Vector Tile Service connections ¶ An option to create connections for ArcGIS Vector Tile Services was added to allow users to easily load vector tile layers from ArcGIS Server vector tile services. It also added support for authentication, configuration, and custom referer string to vector tile connections.\nThis change adds explicit UI options for adding and configuring connections to ESRI vector tile services. While these services use the standard vector tile framework for data retrieval, they can be directly added by creating a connection using the VectorTileService API endpoint on the ArcGIS server.\nAfter a user adds a layer from a VectorTileService, the server's default styling and labeling for the layer is automatically loaded.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nTrust layer metadata propagation ¶ The trust flag at the project level is only used to read the vector layer extent from xml, not from the provider.\nThis flag was not available at the vector layer and data provider level. A new QgsMapLayer reading flag to propagate the trust layer metadata for the project's read flag and a new provider flag to trust the datasource config.\nTrusting the datasource config allows the provider to use estimated metadata, ensures the primary key is unique and that the detectable geometry type and SRID are the same as the requested.\nThis feature was developed by rldhont\nAdd support for virtual columns in Oracle ¶ Support for virtual (generated) Oracle columns has been added and is defined this way:\nsql CREATE TABLE QGIS.GENERATED_COLUMNS ( \u0026quot;pk\u0026quot; INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, \u0026quot;generated_field\u0026quot; GENERATED ALWAYS AS ('test:' || \u0026quot;pk\u0026quot;) VIRTUAL);\nNote: It's not possible to define a generated column on an SDO_GEOMETRY field in Oracle.\nFor now, when creating a new feature, the generated field is editable and should not be. A new API method needs to be added to retrieve readonly field from the provider as discussed in Issue 35995.\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces\nAdd advanced options for data imports ¶ New functionality has been introduced which allows advanced parameters to be specified when importing layers using the OGR data provider, opening a vast range of new possibilities, especially when working around expected dataset issues.\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nQGIS Server ¶ QGIS Server WFS3 API Sorting ¶ Adds sorting functionality to the QGIS Server WFS3 API\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nQGIS Server landing page plugin ¶ A Landing Page Plugin for QGIS Server was created, which is a C++ port of https://github.com/elpaso/qgis-server-landing-page-plugin\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nEnvironment variable to disable GetPrint and to not load layouts ¶ A new QGIS_SERVER_DISABLE_GETPRINT environment variable was added to QGIS Server which prevents the loading of layouts when projects are read and disables the WMS GetPrint request, improving the read time of projects.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by 3Liz\nEnvironment variable to trust layer metadata with server settings ¶ Trust layer metadata can be defined at the project level. A new project reading flag was added which allows the forcing of trust layer metadata.\nFor QGIS server, the trust layer metadata option can be overridden with QGIS_SERVER_TRUST_LAYER_METADATA environment variable.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by 3Liz\nNotable Fixes ¶ Bug fixes by Even Rouault ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.10 backport commit (GitHub) Scrolling attribute table of a layer added with the \u0026quot;delimted text provider\u0026quot; is almost impossible #38068 PR #38735 PR #38745 support for API-keys via query for API implementing OGC API - Features #38436 PR #38738 N/A Custom CRS does not always switch parameters correctly from wkt to proj string #38689 cannot reproduce OGC API Features client always use limit=1000 #38666 cannot reproduce Exporting to geopackage changes field type from DATE to DATETIME #37857 not a bug CSV date field being interpreted as time type #38091 PR #38741 N/A Coordinate Transformation Difference between QGIS and Proj #38190 usage issue gdal_rasterize not working when file has '\u0026amp;' symbol in name #38674 PR #38743 PR #38747 Core dump when using identify feature on a vector polygon #36213 already fixed Error of the raster histogram of QGIS 3.10.8(LTR) #38298 PR #38769 TODO [Postgres] Cannot edit attribute when there is no primary key #37917 not a bug IMHO Switching between WMS info-output formats throws: CRITICAL QTableWidget: cannot insert an item that is already owned by another QTableWidget #37215 PR #38770 PR #38783 SaveAs Geopackage: TEXT fields are converted to TEXT(255) #25405 already fixed \u0026quot;Join attributes by nearest\u0026quot; tool defaults to \u0026quot;None\u0026quot; when using Max distance of 0 #38761 PR #38773 No, not appropriate (see PR #38778) Lost edits in layer of same transaction group #38697 PR #38779 + PR #38780 PR #38824 Preview of Expression String Builder 'freezes' if Feature id higher then available #38646 PR #38797 N/A VectorFileWriter/OGR provider: workaround GDAL 3.1.x bug regarding XLSX and ODS creation not reported PR #38837 PR #38853 Coordinate operation widget: avoid repeating scope and remarks not reported PR #38847 N/A Freeze when showing attribute table of WFS layer #37224 PR #38952 PR #38956 OGR Error when editing a kml file #39087 GDAL Commit 72e1a4d7c96e0381d2d335857697b5f8e1668450 Backported to GDAL 3.1 branch too This feature was funded by QGIS.ORG (through donations and sustaining memberships)\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nBug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.10 backport commit (GitHub) Loading PostGIS layers with no specified geometry loads all features in the attribute table.

Release date: 2021-02-19\nFollowing on from the feature-filled releases of QGIS 3.14 and QGIS 3.16, QGIS 3.18 introduces a host of enhancements and new features, along with a long-awaited feature - Native Point Cloud support in QGIS! Thanks to the efforts of Lutra, North Road, and Hobu, QGIS is now able to import and render point cloud data in various formats by leveraging the Open Source PDAL library. This functionality has been introduced due to the success of a crowd-funding campaign and would not have been possible without the support of the QGIS community and contributors. Thank you to all those involved in realizing this incredible milestone!\nAs QGIS Desktop 3.18 bids farewell to the DB2 database provider, it introduces support for users of the SAP HANA database system.\nThe QGIS ecosystem has also seen some exciting changes in the form of the QGIS HUB which is an extension of the plugin site which now supports the distribution of community developed styles, projects, and even processing models.\nWe would also like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and all the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible. From the QGIS community, we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate time, money, or otherwise get involved in making QGIS more awesome, please wander along to QGIS.ORG and lend a hand!\nQGIS is supported by donors and sustaining members. A current list of donors who have made financial contributions large and small to the project can be seen on our donors list. If you would like to become an official project sustaining member, please visit our sustaining member page for details. Sponsoring QGIS helps us to fund our regular developer meetings, maintain project infrastructure, and fund bug fixing efforts.

Although incredibly valuable, for many use cases this information is verbose. Users will now have the option to toggle the display of derived attributes to create a more concise view of the Identify results.\nThis feature was developed by Richard Duivenvoorde\nFeature: Close all tabs at once from message logs interface ¶ The QgsMessageLogViewer now includes an \u0026quot;Empty tab and close others\u0026quot; to the log viewer panel context menu, supporting a quicker action to a clean interface when debugging.\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang\nFeature: API for layer source widgets ¶ An API has been added in the provider GUI to allow a provider to create a custom widget, which exposes options to customize and change the layer's source. For example, a file-based layer provider could expose a widget for selecting a new file path, or an online provider could expose widgets for changing the host or authentication information.\nTwo implementations have been added for this:\nA file picker widget for GDAL file-based layers. A widget for customizing XYZ layer properties. This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: GUI for dynamic SVGs ¶ QGIS now supports dynamic standard vector graphic elements, as outlined in QEP #199. This allows QGIS to dynamically replace attributes or node values in the XML of the SVG and apply data-driven values to SVG elements. QGIS Desktop has additionally added a GUI editor to ensure that users are able to properly leverage this new functionality.\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Zoom to multiple layers ¶ The \u0026quot;Zoom to Layer\u0026quot; function available from the context menu, the View menu and the Map Navigation toolbar can now zoom to the extent of all the selected layers in the layer tree.\nThis feature was developed by Patrice Pineault\nFeature: Zoom and pan to selection for multiple layers ¶ The \u0026quot;Zoom to Selection\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Pan Map to Selection\u0026quot; functions available from the context menu, the View menu or the Map Navigation toolbox now offer the ability to navigate to the extent of the selection from the selected layers in the layer tree.\nThis feature was developed by Patrice Pineault\nFeature: Zoom in/out by scrolling mouse wheel over map overview panel ¶ Users can now zoom in and out from the Map Overview panel using the mouse scroll.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nAccessibility ¶ Feature: Improved color vision deficiency simulation ¶ This modifies the previous support for grayscale and LMS-based simulation for protanopia and deuteranopia, bringing it in line with the methodology currently used in Chromium and Firefox. QGIS now uses updated grayscale luminance calculations (renamed to achromatopsia), a precomputed protanopia matrix (renamed from protanope), a precomputed deuteranopia matrix (renamed from deuteranope), and an additional mode for tritanopia using a similarly precomputed matrix.\nThis feature was developed by Will Cohen\nFeature: Rotation widget for the Georeferencer ¶ The georeferencer canvas can now be rotated in order to facilitate the placement of reference points. This is especially useful for scanned images which may not have uniform orientations.\nThis feature was developed by uclaros\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Data defined overall symbol opacity ¶ While it was previously possible to set the opacity for individual symbol layer colors via data defined expressions, it is now possible to set a data defined expression to control the overall symbol opacity.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Open the style gallery from the style manager ¶ The Style Manager interface now includes a button to open the styles gallery from the QGIS HUB.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nMesh ¶ Feature: New mesh export algorithms ¶ New export options have been added for mesh layers. These allow the following options when exporting a mesh to a vector layer:\nExport faces Export edges (1D mesh) Export as grid This feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Native export for mesh layers ¶ Previous versions of QGIS required the utilization of the crayfish plugin, however, this functionality has now been incorporated into QGIS core and allows users to export mesh layers to vectors and add the dataset value as an attribute.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Mesh simplification for 3D ¶ Mesh data can now be simplified by defining a level of detail for 3D rendering. This helps performance for complex datasets and ensures a smoother experience when 3D navigation is required.\nThis feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec\nFeature: Multiple native mesh processing algorithms ¶ A number of new processing algorithms have been ported from the crayfish plugin, including:\nRasterize mesh layer Export contour to vector layers Export cross section to text file (csv) Export time series to text file (csv) This feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nRendering ¶ Feature: \u0026quot;Merged feature\u0026quot; renderer for polygon and line layers ¶ A new rendering option allows area and line features to be \u0026quot;dissolved\u0026quot; into a single object prior to rendering to ensure that complex symbols or overlapping features are represented by a uniform and contiguous cartographic symbol.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Smarter Map Redraws ¶ Previously, map redraws would attempt to redraw all elements in the frame. The map rendering has been significantly improved and now the existing map frame elements are used during the redraw process. This work was completed as a part of QEP #181 and was funded by the QGIS Grant program for 2020.\nThe following display outlines the redraw behavior before enhancement:\nThis feature was funded by QGIS grant 2020\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Peter Petrik)\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Eye dome lighting ¶ Eyedome lighting (EDL) is a post-processing effect which compares the depth of each pixel (distance from the camera) with the neighboring pixel depths and highlights edges according to the calculated differences.\nAn EDL configuration element has been added to the advanced settings tab of the 3D view configuration dialog. EDL strength has the effect of increasing the contrast, allowing for better depth perception (which may need to be adjusted when zooming in). EDL distance is the distance of the used pixels from the center pixel and it has the effect of making edges thicker.\nThe eye dome lighting is, by principle, an image-based rendering solution similar to SSAO (screen space ambient occlusion), and therefore works on the whole scene and doesn't differ between point clouds or regular 3D objects.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Nedjima Belgacem)\nFeature: Data defined 3D material colors ¶ 3D material colors may now be data defined, allowing feature colors to be determined using the value of an attribute or expression.\nRendering of polygons may be currently done with multiple material types, each having distinct appearance and configuration of colors:\nRealistic (Phong) material - calculated using 3 colors (diffuse, ambient, specular), which utilizes the 3D view lighting configuration CAD (Gooch) material - calculated using 4 colors (diffuse, warm, cool, specular), which ignores the 3D view lighting configuration Textured materials are unsupported at this time.\nThis feature was funded by Kristianstad\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: 3D Orthographic projection support ¶ QGIS now offers orthographic projection support for 3D scenes, a feature often desired in the context of architecture, archeology, and more.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nPoint Clouds ¶ Feature: Point Cloud Support ¶ Following the successful crowdfunding campaign for point cloud support in QGIS, the engineers at Lutra, North Road, and Hobu have been able to introduce the ability for QGIS to import and render point cloud data.\nThis includes the ability to add point cloud layers to QGIS projects, with support for the EPT format, and render them in 2D and 3D contexts.\nThis feature was funded by Point Cloud data support in QGIS\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Peter Petrik)\nFeature: Add point clouds to browser ¶ The QGIS Browser and data source management interface now support the basic structure of PDAL supported point cloud layers.\nThis feature was funded by Point Cloud data support in QGIS crowd funding campaign\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Peter Petrik)\nFeature: Untwine PDAL Provider Integration ¶ Ability to generate EPT index for (smaller) laz files directly in QGIS via the untwine library\nThis feature was funded by Point Cloud data support in QGIS crowd funding campaign\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Peter Petrik)\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Gradient ramp based legends ¶ A new QgsColorRampLegendNode class was added which allows for the creation of color ramp-based legend nodes. It's now used for raster layers when using a pseudocolor renderer with the linear interpolation type or for the single-band gray renderer, as well as for point clouds using a ramp based renderer.\nIn a layout legend, the ramp item inherits the default legend symbol width and height, but it is possible to optionally override this behavior.\nThere are labels included for the minimum and maximum ramp value, which are rendered using the same font settings as other legend item text:\nLabel alignment will follow the legend settings:\nAnd naturally, the items will work nicely with multi-column legends:\nThis feature was funded by Hans van der Kwast\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Color ramp legend improvements ¶ Color ramp legend items now support the following configurable options:\nA prefix and suffix for the ramp text Numerical formatting Ramp direction Customization of text formatting The ability to create horizontal bars. Users can also choose to refine these settings for a particular layout legend item. This functionality is available for all ramp items, including raster, point cloud, or mesh layers.\nThis feature was funded by Hans van der Kwast\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Dynamic text presets ¶ The new Add Item -\u0026gt; Dynamic Text menu contains preset dynamic text expressions that users can use to insert a label automatically containing the corresponding expression.\nFor example, using the dynamic text element Layout Name will insert a label containing the expression [% @layout_name %]. This improves the feature awareness, discoverability, and provides an easy method for users to access dynamic attributes.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Optional formatting of UUID results ¶ There is now a string format parameter available for the uuid() function in QGIS expressions. Users now have various options that they can use to stipulate the format of the returned UUID value, including the following options:\nuuid(): {0bd2f60f-f157-4a6d-96af-d4ba4cb366a1} uuid('WithoutBraces'): 0bd2f60f-f157-4a6d-96af-d4ba4cb366a1 uuid('Id128'): 0bd2f60ff1574a6d96afd4ba4cb366a1 This feature was developed by signedav\nFeature: Layer CRS variable for expressions ¶ QGIS expressions now support a layer_crs variable which will return the AuthID for a particular layer's coordinate reference system. This allows expressions to identify the layer CRS dynamically and perform transformations without needing to manually specify the CRS.\nThis feature was developed by Alex\nFeature: Support for min, max, majority, sum, mean, and median functions on numerical arrays ¶ QGIS expressions now include aggregate functions for arrays, which allow the easy retrieval of specific values from an array that may be used in QGIS elements such as symbologies. The following functions have been introduced:\narray_min array_max array_majority array_sum array_mean array_median This feature was developed by uclaros\nFeature: Negative index for array_get function ¶ The function array_get now supports the use of negative index positions.\nThis feature was developed by Alex\nFeature: Add map_credits function ¶ A map_credits function was added that collates a list of all the layer metadata attribution strings for the layers shown inside a specified map item.\nFor example:\narray_to_string( map_credits( 'Main Map' ) ) Returns a comma-separated list of layer credits for layers shown in the 'Main Map' layout item, e.g 'CC-BY-NC, CC-BY-SA'\nThere's an optional include_layer_names argument you can use to include layer names before their attribution:\narray_to_string( map_credits( 'Main Map', include_layer_names := true, layer_name_separator := ': ' ) ) This would return a comma-separated list of layer names and their credits for layers shown in the 'Main Map' layout item, e.g. 'Railway lines: CC-BY-NC, Basemap: CC-BY-SA'\nThis feature was funded by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Select features context menu ¶ It is now possible to select features using a context menu on the map canvas. Right-clicking on the map will intelligently identify the features below the mouse cursor and allow the available features to be added or removed from the current selection. Where multiple features are available, a short delay may persist whilst the system attempts to search for available features that will become available in a nested menu item for selection, or users may simply use the select all function to select all available features at the given position.\nThis feature was funded by Kristianstad\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Curve tracing settings added to UI ¶ Existing curve tracing settings were introduced previously and have now been exposed in the user interface to enable users to incrementally modify settings to optimize their results when capturing curve data.\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang\nFeature: Feature scaling tool ¶ A new digitizing tool allows for selected features to be scaled when in editing mode. This implementation was based on the work of @roya0045 with #40650.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nData Management ¶ Feature: New export to spreadsheet algorithm ¶ Users may export a selection of vector layers as sheets in a new spreadsheet or append them as additional sheets to an existing spreadsheet\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Reproject coordinates in the Georeferencer ¶ The georeferencer now reprojects data points in a desired output projection, rather than using the map canvas CRS for determining data point positions. This allows users more flexibility and control when capturing control points.\nThis feature was developed by Alex\nFeature: Polymorphic relations/ Document management system ¶ A new GUI is available to manage polymorphic relations, implemented as a part of the dynamic relations described in QEP #79.\nThe \u0026quot;Add relation\u0026quot; button in the relation manager screen now has additional options for adding and editing polymorphic relations:\nThe \u0026quot;Add polymorphic relation\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Edit polymorphic relation\u0026quot; open the same dialog, although in the latter case it will automatically be populated with existing values.\nOnce saved, the list of relations appear as a tree widget, where the generated relation objects for a polymorphic relation appear as children. The names of the generated relations cannot be changed.\nPolymorphic relations are stored within a project and currently cannot be exported.\nThis feature was developed by Ivan Ivanov\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Soft and hard constraints in forms ¶ Historically, required fields would prevent a form from being saved entirely. Using soft constraints allow forms to notify users that expected information has been omitted, without preventing the form submission. Hard constraints, by contrast, function identically to the previous \u0026quot;required fields\u0026quot; functionality and will prevent form submissions unless data is correctly captured for the field.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Viktor Sklencar)\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: Nominatim geocoder API ¶ Although not exposed through the locator or as an algorithm, QGIS now includes a Nominatim API geocoder class. The geocoder class' implementation insures that it respects the OpenStreetMap Foundation Terms of Use by caching results and throttling requests by default.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Allow expression for order fields in PointsToPath algorithm ¶ $id may be used as an expression for a csv with ordered values, and the ORDER_EXPRESSION parameter has been added to the PointsToPath algorithm.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Override CRS for Clip Raster by extent output ¶ In some instances, the Clip raster by extent algorithm may output features without a CRS specified, which can now be modified by explicitly enforcing the output to inherit it's CRS from the input layer.\nThis feature was developed by rldhont\nFeature: Add \u0026quot;retain fields\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ Allows users to select a list of fields to keep, and all other fields will be dropped from the layer. Helps with making flexible models where input datasets may have a range of different fields and only a certain subset of them need to be retained. This work was inspired by #39114\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Reference common field parameter for multiple layers ¶ Processing tools field parameters may support processing a common field for multiple vector layers, in an implementation inspired by the behavior of some processing algorithms in Orfeo ToolBox.\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces\nFeature: Extend import geotagged photos to include exif_orientation ¶ The \u0026quot;Import geotagged photos\u0026quot; tool has been updated so that the exif_orientation parameter value is extracted to the output table. This ensures that maptips and other HTML widgets can be configured to correctly transform the photos to be correctly displayed based on the orientation value.\nThis feature was developed by Pelle Rosenbeck Gøeg\nFeature: Export layer information algorithm ¶ A new algorithm in the processing toolbox called export layers information has been added to support the creation of a polygon layer corresponding to extent of user-defined layer(s) with additional layer details which are attached as attributes to each polygon feature. The information collected currently supports the following elements:\nCRS Provider name File path Layer name Subset filter Abstract Attribution This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Cell stack percentile and percentrank algorithms ¶ The characteristics of the Cell Statistics processing tool have been replicated and modified to allow for three new processing algorithms, which allow QGIS to calculate cell statistics in a similar manner to common percentage functions used in spreadsheet programs. The new processing algorithms are:\nCell stack percentile Cell stack percentrank from value Cell stack percentrank from raster layer While the percentile algorithm only offers the possibility of calculating percentiles based on an input fraction value (ranging between 0 and 1), a percentrank raster can also be calculated based on an input value raster. This gives the user the opportunity to calculate per-cell percentranks based on dataset driven value input (eg. sample layers).\nAll algorithms provide different methods for calculating percentiles and percentranks:\nPercentile: - Nearest Rank - Inclusive linear interpolation (see LibreOffice's and Microsoft Excel's PERCENTILE.INC function) - Exclusive linear interpolation (see LibreOffice's and Microsoft Excel's PERCENTILE.EXC function)\nPercentrank: - Inclusive linear interpolation (see LibreOffice's and Microsoft Excel's PERCENTRANK.INC function) - Exclusive linear interpolation (see LibreOffice's and Microsoft Excel's PERCENTRANK.EXC function)\nThis feature was developed by Clemens Raffler\nFeature: Points to lines processing algorithm ¶ A native processing algorithm has been added in c++ that creates line layers from point layers, similar to the existing python Points to path but with extended functionality:\nAdded support for natural sorting ( '10' \u0026gt; '9' ) Avoid creating invalid lines with a single vertex Avoid creating closed lines with two vertices This feature was developed by uclaros\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Hidden layers ¶ QGIS Projects now support the inclusion of hidden layers, which are capable of being included in a project but are not visible in the table of contents.\nThe layer property is configurable from the Data Sources tab of the project properties and includes API support for text filtering.\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Custom \u0026quot;Full Extent\u0026quot; definition ¶ A new \u0026quot;View Settings\u0026quot; tab has been added to the project properties, with the option to manually defined the full extent of a project. The extent defined here will be the extent used when zooming to the full map extent, instead of the calculated or maximum extent of all layers. This is useful for defining a particular area of interest for a project and does not limit user's ability to \u0026quot;zoom out\u0026quot; further than the defined extent.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Toggle network caching to QgsNetworkAccessManager ¶ A checkbox in the network logger panel now allows users to temporarily disable the network cache, which is useful when debugging QGIS network activity, or when using QGIS to test server-side changes.\nThis is a transient setting by design and is forgotten as soon as QGIS is closed.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Unify ArcGis Feature Service and ArcGIS Map Service connections in browser ¶ The separate \u0026quot;ArcGis Feature Service\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;ArcGIS Map Service\u0026quot; browser connections have been replaced with a single, unified, \u0026quot;ArcGIS Rest Servers\u0026quot; connection and browser node, which shows a definitive view of the server and exposes both service types.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow browsing ArcGIS REST by content groups ¶ ArcGIS Feature Service connections which have their corresponding Portal endpoint URLS set can be explored by content groups in the browser panel.\nIf a connection has the Portal endpoints set, then expanding out the connection in the browser will show a \u0026quot;Groups\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Services\u0026quot; folder, instead of the full list of services usually shown. Expanding out the groups folder will show a list of all content groups that the user is a member of, each of which can be expanded to show the service items belonging to that group.\nThis feature was funded by SRK Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Native DXF export algorithm ¶ Allows exporting individual or multiple layers into a single DXF file. For each input layer, users can select which attribute to use for splitting a single layer into multiple output layers.\nImplements a native DXF export algorithm using QgsDxfExport functionality, which is also used by Project -\u0026gt; Import/Export -\u0026gt; Export Project to DXF.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Additional geometry types for PostGIS Export ¶ Some available geometry types from the GDAL ogr2ogr operation used for exporting data to PostGIS databases have been added to the tool interface. This functionality also includes the option to specify vector dimensions for exported data and resolves issue 39003.\nThis feature was developed by mazano\nFeature: Improved network requests with GDAL ¶ A QgsCPLHTTPFetchOverrider utility class was added and used in the OGR provider which redirects GDAL's CPL HTTP calls through QgsBlockingNetworkRequest. This ensures that GDAL can use the QGIS network provider rather than redirecting requests through cURL. Additional head(), put() and deleteResource() methods were added to QgsBlockingNetworkRequest.\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nFeature: Read only generated fields ¶ An API method has been added to ensure that readonly generated columns are not exposed in editors.\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces\nFeature: Improve MSSQL loading with predefined parameters ¶ To reduce layer loading times, the map layer extent can be precomputed, and primary keys can be specified, removing the need for QGIS to calculate these characteristics and improving performance.\nThis is done by extending dbo.geometry_columns tables and adding the following extra columns, which may be populated accordingly by database administrators:\nExtent : qgis_xmin, qgis_xmax, qgis_ymin, qgis_ymax Primary key : qgis_pkey In the database connection configuration widget, there are now two extra checkboxes which make use of these parameters:\nUse layer extent from the extra columns Use the primary key from the extra column This feature was funded by ms.GIS\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Filter schemas for MS SQL ¶ Users may now filter the available schemas for MS SQL connections. The database connection widget now contains options for filtering available schemas, so that only the expected schemas are available from the QGIS browser.\nThis feature was funded by ms.GIS\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: SAP HANA database support ¶ QGIS now supports SAP HANA databases. SAP HANA is an in-memory database with an OGC-compliant spatial engine with a free express edition available from www.sap.com\nThis feature was developed by Maxim Rylov\nFeature: Deprecate support for DB2 ¶ The DB2 data provider has been marked as deprecated, and is hidden from the QGIS UI by default.\nQGIS has adopted a gentle approach to removing unmaintained core providers, and users of deprecated providers may enable support for them by setting the hidden \u0026quot;providers/showDeprecated\u0026quot; settings key to true.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Oracle connection API ¶ The QGIS API now includes QgsAbstractDatabaseProviderConnection for the Oracle provider.\nThis feature was funded by Metropole de Lille\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces\nFeature: Add advanced options for raster data imports ¶ New functionality has been introduced which allows advanced parameters to be specified when importing layers using the GDAL data provider, opening a vast range of new possibilities, especially when working around expected dataset issues and shortcomings.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: GetLegendGraphics Symbol Scale ¶ The QGIS Server WMS GetLegendGraphics request now supports the inclusion of min/max scale denominators to json symbol exports\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Drag and drop for WMS GetFeatureInfo response ¶ With the drag and drop editor form, it is possible to reorder the attributes and add groups or subgroups from within the edit form.

Having this format as the default format will ease a lot the path to go to a container able to embed resources like SVG, offline data in GPKG, color ramps, plugins or scripts.\nThis feature was developed by OSLANDIA - Paul Blottiere\nFeature: Filtering for field values in Query Builder ¶ When creating a new expression filter in query builder, you can now filter the field values preview panel.\nThis feature was developed by Salvatore Larosa\nFeature: FULL screen Map via Ctrl-Shift-Tab ¶ Besides Ctrl-Tab you can now do Ctrl-Shift-Tab, which will show you the Map and ONLY the Map, no more toolbars or buttons (or even without Window Title, in combination with F11). Great for Full Screen Map projection via Beamer or on Big Screens. You can still zoom and pan! (Based on work of Mathieu Pellerin)\nThis feature was developed by Richard Duivenvoorde\nMap Tools ¶ Feature: Simplify map tool can now also smooth features ¶ The Simplify Features map tool has been renamed to \u0026quot;Simplify/Smooth Features\u0026quot;, and now supports interactive smoothing of features.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Identify Tool with extra options ¶ With the new improvements, user can now use similar tools to the Selection to identify multiple features.\nThis feature was funded by Leicestershire County Council and East Hampshire District Council\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias and Viktor Sklencar\nFeature: Store also expanded/collapsed state of nodes in map Themes ¶ Each map theme will also record which layers, groups and legend items are expanded, so when a map theme is selected, the expanded/collapsed states get applied in the layer tree.\nThis feature was funded by Arpa Piemonte (Dipartimento Tematico Geologia e Dissesto) within ERIKUS project\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting) and Faunalia\nFeature: Auto \u0026quot;Zoom to Selection\u0026quot; mode for new map views ¶ A new map view can be configured to automatically zoom to the current selection. Could be combined with different map themes as in this example.\nThis feature was funded by Technology One\nThis feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: Choice of simplification method for simplify map tool ¶ This allows different techniques to be used for simplification in the interactive simplify map tool, including the more cartographically pleasing \u0026quot;Visvalingam\u0026quot; simplification algorithm.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: add zoom to related feature in forms ¶ A new button appears in the feature attribute sub form when one or more records are selected in a related table. The button zooms the map to these features if they have geometries.\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer\nFeature: Cartesian areas/lengths/perimeters in identify results ¶ In QGIS 3.2 we now show both ellipsoidal and cartesian areas, lengths and perimeters separately within the identify results panel. Seeing the two distinct measurements gives users a better understanding of potential issues in area or distance calculations caused by incorrect projection or ellipsoid choices.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nExpressions ¶ Feature: New expression functions ¶ color_grayscale_average() color_mix_rgb() flip_coordinates() wedge_buffer() tapered_buffer() buffer_by_m() New variables:\n@project_home @project_author @project_abstract @project_creation_date @project_identifier @project_keywords This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin, Nyall Dawson\nFeature: More helpful expression builder ¶ The expression builder now makes it easier to build expressions within QGIS!\nThe builder now shows the description for data defined values, including the range of expected values from the expression Ctrl+clicking a function name in the current expression will automatically open the help for that function It now shows indicators for parts of expressions with errors It shows a complete list of error messages obtained from parsing the expression This feature was funded by Technology One\nThis feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Layers panel: indicators for filtered map layers ¶ The main window's layer tree view (ToC) gets support for indicators that are shown when a vector layer has a filter applied. This makes it easier for users to understand that they are looking at a subset of all data. Clicking the indicator's icon brings up query builder.\nThis adds a mini-framework for display of extra icons in layer tree views next to layer and group names. Tool tip text can be associated with indicators to give extra context for indicators. In addition, a signal gets emitted when user clicks indicators and custom actions can be defined. The idea is that indicators can be used in the future for a subtle reporting of various bits of information, for example:\nmap layer with invalid geometries map layer with on-the-fly reprojection exceptions map layer has missing data source map layer with invalid CRS This feature was funded by Arpa Piemonte (Dipartimento Tematico Geologia e Dissesto) within ERIKUS project\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting) and Faunalia\nFeature: Allow customizing prefix of locator filters ¶ Prefixes of locator filters can now be customized under the application settings in the \u0026quot;Locator\u0026quot; tab\nThis feature was funded by QGIS User Group Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud, OPENGIS.ch\nFeature: Opening of vector and raster stored on HTTP(S), FTP, or cloud services ¶ In 3.2, the data source manager's vector and raster panels have been updated to simplify opening of vector and raster datasets stored on HTTP(S), FTP, or cloud services. Basic HTTP(S) authentication support included.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Quick calculator in locator search bar ¶ QGIS 3.2 allows evaluation of simple expressions (well, actually ANY QGIS expression... so you could use aggregates and the like if you really wanted!) by entering \u0026quot;= \u0026quot; followed by an expression into the locator bar. If a valid expression is entered, users are given an option to copy the result to the clipboard.\nE.g. entering \u0026quot;= 10/3\u0026quot; shows a locator entry \u0026quot;Copy '3.3333333' to clipboard\u0026quot;.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Shortcuts for toggling panels ¶ Ctrl+{no} shortcut\nThis feature was funded by Technology One\nThis feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: Bookmark searching in locator ¶ Allows search for spatial bookmarks. Double clicking a search result will zoom to the bookmark.\nShort video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymW4TU8QWy4\nThe new filter presents itself with a prefix of \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; and with tr( \u0026quot;Spatial bookmarks\u0026quot; ) as displayname.\nThis feature was developed by Klavs Pihlkjær\nFeature: Close and Revert Project actions ¶ Two new actions have been added to the \u0026quot;Project\u0026quot; menu\n\u0026quot;Close\u0026quot;: Closes the active project, returning the QGIS window to the \u0026quot;Recent Projects\u0026quot; list \u0026quot;Revert\u0026quot;: Restores the active project to the last saved state, discarding all unsaved changes This feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow, Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Unsaved changes indicator in title bar ¶ QGIS 3.2 now follows the standard UI approach of indicating that the current project has unsaved changes by adding a \u0026quot;*\u0026quot; prefix to the project name in the application title bar. This makes it easy to see if you have unsaved changes at a single glance!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Configurable map tips delay ¶ This feature was developed by jdugge\nFeature: Move layer or group to top of layer panel ¶ Moves the selected layer(s) or group(s) to the top of the layer panel.\nThis feature was developed by Mie Winstrup\nFeature: Copy statistics panel content to clipboard button ¶ It is now possible to copy the statistics panel's output table into the clipboard.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Search Settings, Options, and Project Properties pages from locator ¶ Short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duB2YekUmV0\nThe new filter presents itself with a prefix of \u0026quot;s\u0026quot; and with tr( \u0026quot;Settings\u0026quot; ) as displayname.\nThis feature was developed by Klavs Pihlkjær\nFeature: Indicators for embedded layers and groups ¶ Embedded project layers and groups are now flagged by a handy \u0026quot;embedded\u0026quot; indicator, making it immediately clear to users which layers and groups have been embedded inside a project.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Nicer colors for new layers ¶ The \u0026quot;random\u0026quot; colors assigned to new map layers are no longer \u0026quot;random\u0026quot; but instead randomly selected from a preset palette of \u0026quot;visually pleasing\u0026quot; colors. Say goodbye to ugly baby puke green layers!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nRendering ¶ Feature: Improved map Copyright decoration ¶ Expression support for the copyright text. Improved text formatting options, including shadows, outlines, backgrounds, etc. This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Main window scale bar font size and family can be customized ¶ This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Custom SVG path and size for the north arrow decoration ¶ This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nData Management ¶ Feature: Refresh a materialized view ¶ From the browser, with a right click on a materialized view, you can now refresh it.\nThis feature was developed by Etienne Trimaille\nFeature: Z and M support for offline editing ¶ Offline editing now also supports layers with Z and M coordinates.\nThis feature was funded by Oester Messtechnik\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn, OPENGIS.ch\nFeature: Metadata for QGIS projects ¶ Continuing the metadata work begun in QGIS 3.0, 3.2 now supports metadata for QGIS projects. This allows for detailed metadata to be set in project properties, including abstracts, keywords, contact details, links, etc.\nThis feature was funded by Arpa Piemonte (Dipartimento Tematico Geologia e Dissesto) within ERIKUS project\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road) and Faunalia\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Multi-column layout for multiselect value relation widget ¶ The value relation widget with multi selection enabled now supports multiple columns. This allows better usage of horizontal screen space.\nThis feature was funded by Grundbuch- und Vermessungsamt des Kanton Zug\nThis feature was developed by David Signer, OPENGIS.ch\nFeature: Allow using a URL for custom attribute forms (UI file) ¶ The UI file will be downloaded on every session on the first usage. This makes it possible to easily distribute updated UI files to clients.\nThis feature was funded by SIRS\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud, OPENGIS.ch\nFeature: Drill-down (cascading) forms ¶ QGIS 3.2 introduces drill-down (cascading) form support, where the values available in one field depend on the values of other fields. This feature allows users to create \u0026ldquo;value-relation\u0026rdquo; expressions based on the current value of another field in the same form. When the user modifies a field\u0026rsquo;s value, the choices available in all related fields are filtered to match the new value \u0026ndash; allowing a hierarchical filtering strategy (drill-down, or cascading) inside a form.\nThis feature was funded by Grant Boxer, NaturalGIS, Tudor Bărăscu, NotioGIS, République et canton de Neuchâtel, Arpa Piemonte, Nelson Silva, QGIS Danish User Group, Bo Victor Thomsen and Lene Fischer, North River Geographic\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti (North Road)\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: Optional text on top of symbols for vector layers ¶ This feature allows users to add extra information to the symbols in the legend.\nThis feature was funded by Arpa Piemonte (Dipartimento Tematico Geologia e Dissesto) within ERIKUS project\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting) and Faunalia\nFeature: Copy\u0026amp;Paste Group/Layers from a QGIS project to another. ¶ Allowing to copy and paste groups or layers between projects and profiles.\nThis feature was developed by Salvatore Larosa\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: Data defined table source for attribute table items ¶ When an attribute table is set to a \u0026quot;Layer features\u0026quot; source, this new feature allows the underlying vector layer from which to source features to be data defined.\n(All existing table attributes (column settings) are left intact, so setting a data defined table to a layer with different fields will result in empty columns in the table.)\nThis feature was funded by Kartoza/InaSAFE\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Project metadata embedded in layout exports ¶ Saving a print layout to SVG, PDF or images will now embed any project metadata in the created file. Support for different metadata elements depends on the individual export format.\nThis feature was funded by Arpa Piemonte (Dipartimento Tematico Geologia e Dissesto) within ERIKUS project\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Better formatting for scalebar text ¶ QGIS 3.2 allows the full range of text formatting options to be used within scalebar text, e.g. buffers, shadows, and background shapes.\nUnreadable scale bar text is a thing of the past!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Improved 'Join by attribute table' algorithm ¶ The 'Join by attribute table' algorithm has been upgraded to support one-to-many joins (i.e. create separate features for each matching feature) as well as an option to discard records which could not be joined. Additionally, an optional prefix for joined fields can now be specified.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin, Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Load script from template ¶ New option to load Processing scripts from a custom template\nThis feature was developed by Matteo Ghetta (Faunalia)\nFeature: Feature filter algorithm for processing models ¶ Add a new feature filter algorithm for the processing modeler. Allows filtering features of a source based on expressions and send matching features to different outputs as final products or different algorithm pipeline for further processing.\nRead this blog post for more information.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS User Group Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn, OPENGIS.ch\nFeature: Zonal histogram ¶ This new algorithm appends fields representing counts of each unique value from a raster layer contained within zones defined as polygons.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Port Union, Difference and Intersection algorithms to C++ ¶ QGIS native geoprocessing algorithms have been ported from Python to C++. In addition to performance boost, several bugs have been resolved with this update.\nThis feature was funded by InaSAFE DFAT\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: 'Project points (cartesian)' algorithm ¶ This new Processing algorithm projects points from an input point layer by a specified distance and bearing (azimuth). It supports dynamic parameters for the distance and bearing so that the distance and bearing can be taken from field values or expressions.\nThis feature was funded by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Dynamic parameter values for more algorithms ¶ QGIS 3.2 extends the work begun in 3.0 to allow \u0026quot;dynamic\u0026quot; parameters for selected Processing algorithms. Dynamic parameters allow users to use expressions or field values to specify the value of a parameter while the algorithm executes, so e.g. the buffer size can be dynamically calculated for each individual feature buffered.\nIn 3.2 the following algorithms now support dynamic parameters:\nDelete holes Remove Duplicate Vertices Simplify Smooth Snap to Grid Subdivide Transect Translate This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Multi-ring buffer (constant distance) algorithm ¶ This new algorithm computes multi-ring ('donuts') buffer for all the features in an input layer, using a fixed or dynamic distance and rings number.\nThis feature was developed by Alex Bruy\nFeature: New \u0026quot;segmentize\u0026quot; algorithms ¶ In QGIS 3.2 two new algorithms for segmentizing curved geometries have been added to Processing.\n\u0026quot;Segmentize by maximum distance\u0026quot;: The segmentization is performed by specifying the maximum allowed offset distance between the original curve and the segmentized representation.\n\u0026quot;Segmentize by maximum angle\u0026quot;: The segmentization is performed by specifying the maximum allowed radius angle between vertices on the straightened geometry (e.g the angle of the arc created from the original arc center to consective output vertices on the linearized geometry).\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Option to create points on all polygon parts ¶ The \u0026quot;Centroid\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Point on surface\u0026quot; algorithms have a new option to create points for every individual part of input geometries.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Rotate Features algorithm ¶ This new algorithm allows rotation of features by a set angle. The rotation can occur around a preset point or each individual feature's centroid.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Line sinuosity in \u0026quot;Add Geometry Attributes\u0026quot; ¶ The \u0026quot;Add Geometry Attributes\u0026quot; algorithm now calculates line sinuosity and straight distance for line layers.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Import geotagged photos ¶ In QGIS 3.2 a new \u0026quot;Import geotagged photos\u0026quot; algorithm has been added to Processing. It allows selection of a folder which it will scan for jpg files which have been geotagged and creates a PointZ layer with the result, with attributes for photo path, altitude, direction and timestamp.\nOptionally the scan can be recursive and you can create an optional table of photos which could not be read or which were missing geotags.\nThe algorithm automatically sets the output table to use an external resource widget to display the linked photos in the attribute form.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Swap x/y coordinate values algorithm ¶ This algorithm swaps the X and Y coordinate values in input geometries. It can be used to repair geometries which have accidentally had their latitude and longitude values reversed.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Sort order option for \u0026quot;Add Incremental Field\u0026quot; ¶ This change allows users to optionally set a sort order to use when assigning values in the Add Incremental Field algorithm. Previously values were always added using the original feature order. With this change users can control the order in which features are assigned values.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Indicator for distance parameter units ¶ When an algorithm uses a \u0026quot;distance\u0026quot; type parameter, the units will now be shown next to the parameter. This avoids the confusion when running algorithms which use distances where the unit depends on a layer or CRS parameter - e.g. the distance parameter in the buffer algorithm gives the distance in layer units... so now in QGIS 3.2 we show those units directly within the dialog. Hopefully this leads to less user confusion and accidental \u0026quot;1000 degree buffers\u0026quot;!\nAdditionally - if the unit is in degrees, a small warning icon is shown next to the parameter. The tooltip for this icon advises users to reproject data into a suitable projected local coordinate system.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Algorithm log can be saved/cleared/copied ¶ In the algorithm execution dialog, new buttons have been added to allow users to save the current log (to text or HTML files), copy the log contents to the clipboard, and clear the log.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Wedge buffer algorithm ¶ This new algorithm creates wedge shaped buffers from input points.\nThe azimuth parameter gives the angle (in degrees) for the middle of the wedge to point. The buffer width (in degrees) is specified by the width parameter. Note that the wedge will extend to half of the angular width either side of the azimuth direction. The outer radius of the buffer is specified via outer radius, and optionally an inner radius can also be specified.\nThe algorithm supports dynamic parameters for azimuth, width, and radius.\nThe native output from this algorithm is CurvePolygon geometries, but these may be automatically segmentized to Polygons depending on the output format.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Variable width buffers ¶ New Processing algorithms have been added to create variable width buffers, including tapered buffers (with a specified start and end diameter) and variable width buffers from line string m values.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Reclassify raster algorithms ¶ Two new native QGIS raster reclassification algorithms have been added to Processing. These are simple to use, yet fast and stable, and work for ANY raster layer type supported by QGIS!\nReclassify by layer: reclassifies a raster using the ranges specified via min/max/value fields from a vector table Reclassify by table: reclassifies a raster using a fixed table entered by users in the algorithm dialog This feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Union algorithm with a single layer ¶ The union algorithm can be now run with just a single input layer in order to resolve any overlaps among the layer's features. For example, if an area is covered by three features, that area will be cut out from those features and three new features will be added, copying attributes of the original features.\nThis feature was funded by InaSAFE DFAT\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Mandatory layers in project ¶ Required layers are not allowed to be removed from the project. This adds extra safety to protect project users from removing layers they may think are not needed (e.g. used in joins, relations, expressions).\nThis feature was funded by Arpa Piemonte (Dipartimento Tematico Geologia e Dissesto) within ERIKUS project\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting) and Faunalia\nFeature: Saving and loading projects in PostgreSQL database ¶ Users can now save their projects within a PostgreSQL database. Project can be saved in menu Projects \u0026gt; Save To \u0026gt; PostgreSQL and loaded using menu Projects \u0026gt; Load From \u0026gt; PostgreSQL. Projects saved in database can be loaded also through the browser dock (projects show up under the schema where they were saved, together with other layers).\nSaving/loading QGIS projects must be explicitly enabled in PostgreSQL connection settings: there is a new option \u0026quot;Allow saving/loading QGIS projects in the database\u0026quot; which is disabled by default.\nNew API has been introduced that allows creation of custom project storage implementations (may be used by plugins). Related QEP: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/118\nThis feature was funded by Arpa Piemonte (Dipartimento Tematico Geologia e Dissesto) within ERIKUS project\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias, Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting) and Faunalia\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Save/Load connections for XYZ Tiles ¶ From the Browser panel, XYZ Tiles entries can be exported/imported to/from an XML file.\nThis feature was developed by Salvatore Larosa\nFeature: Project home path can be manually set ¶ This new feature in QGIS 3.2 allows the project home path (which is used by the browser to create the 'Project Home' item) to be set by users for a project, instead of always matching the location where the project is saved.\nThis allows users to set the project home to a folder which contains data and other content, and is especially useful for organisations where QGIS projects are not stored in the root folder of a organisational 'project'.\nProject home paths can also be set to relative paths, in which case they will be relative to the project saved location.\nThe path can be set through the Project Properties dialog, or by right-clicking on the Project Home browser item and selecting 'Set Project Home'.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Support for mesh layers ¶ Initial work has been done to introduce mesh layers supporting display of data on structured or unstructured meshes (grids) in addition to raster and vector layers. This is still a work in progress, expected to be fully ready in QGIS 3.4. The work so far lead to creation of a new library MDAL for handling of different formats of mesh-based data and there are new APIs introduced under the hood, however the user interface is not implemented yet.\nFor more information see:\nhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/119\nand\nhttps://github.com/lutraconsulting/MDAL\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik and Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Automatically set default style for layers for ArcGIS Feature Server layers ¶ When layers from a Feature Server are loaded into QGIS 3.2, they will automatically have the same style applied as has been specified for that layer on the server, matching the appearance of the layer when it is loaded into ArcGIS.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Faster Oracle queries ¶ Certain operations are greatly sped up for Oracle layers, e.g. case-insensitive value matches for features.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Restrict table list for a Oracle database connection to a preset schema ¶ This change allows a schema to be set in the connection properties for an Oracle database connection. If set, only tables within that schema will be scanned and listed for the connection.\nPreviously the option existed to restrict the scan to tables which belong to the user, but this option does not support the use case where a connection must access tables from a different user, and the default \u0026quot;scan everything\u0026quot; setting is too expensive (since it often takes multiple minutes to perform, especially when geometryless tables are shown).\nThis feature was funded by Open Spatial\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Read only support for curved Oracle geometries ¶ Previously these geometries were silently discarded.\nThis feature was funded by Open Spatial\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Adding query history in DB Manager ¶ In 3.2 it is possible to store SQL queries. The query history is available into the SQL Window tab of the DB Manager plugin.\nThis feature was developed by Salvatore Larosa\nFeature: DB Manager SQL execution in background ¶ This feature was developed by Paul Blottiere\n3D Features ¶ Feature: 3D Polygons: Optionally generate back faces ¶ Sometimes datasets with 3D polygons do not have consistent ordering of vertices (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) and that caused sub-optimal results in the 3D view: either some polygons (walls) seem to be missing if back-face culling is enabled - or some polygons are shaded incorrectly if back-face culling is disabled. With the new option Add back faces enabled, the tessellator will generate triangles in both directions (front and back) which greatly improves the rendering quality for such datasets.\nThe only downside when using this option is that more graphical memory is used (double amount of vertex data). Make sure to set culling mode to \u0026quot;Back\u0026quot; when using this option, otherwise there would be no visible difference as the scene would still render polygons with incorrect shading.\nThe image contains freely available Prague 3D buildings dataset.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog32/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 3.2"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 3.20 ¶ Release date: 2021-06-18\nQGIS 3.20 Odense features a splash screen which displays a section of the earliest map of Denmark\u0026rsquo;s third largest city, Odense from 1593. The map was published by Georg Braun (1541-1622) in the work Civitates orbis terrarum (Cities of the World). Georg Braun\u0026rsquo;s maps are all beautiful and were, for the period, produced at a high cartographic level. Civitates orbis terrarum was long the main source of maps of the world\u0026rsquo;s cities, such as Paris, London, Mexico City and Aden.\nThe name Odense literally means \u0026ldquo;Odin\u0026rsquo;s temple\u0026rdquo;, and the place may have originally been a shrine to the pagan god Odin. At the bottom left of the map you see the ruins of one of the large Viking-Age ring-shaped fortress, which were constructed in Denmark by the Danish Viking king Harald Bluetooth (died c. 985/86). The ring fortress in Odense is called Nonnebakken.\nThis release introduces a host of subtle changes and stability updates, reinforcing the vast catalog of cutting-edge features introduced in recent QGIS releases. Included in this release are numerous data management improvements, with some advanced changes to the management and display of CRS systems and projection information. Amongst these improvements to CRS management are the basic support for coordinate epoch of dynamic CRS systems and advanced accuracy integrity warnings, placing QGIS 3.20 firmly at the leading edge of GIS and data management practices for high accuracy systems.\nAdditionally, users can expect improved metadata management and handling for certain data and metadata types. Another key highlight is the native integration of the nominatim geocoding service, which will allow users to search locations and addresses using data from the OpenStreetMap project directly from the QGIS locator bar.\nThe QGIS Community has also seen an uptick in activity in the QGIS HUB, as well as the Virtual QGIS Open Days, with the Cutting Edge Open Day showcasing a number of demonstrations which leverage rich QGIS functionality that was introduced in more recent releases.\nWe would also like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and all the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible. From the QGIS community, we hope you enjoy this release!

and \u0026quot;Autosize\u0026quot; for columns has been extended to apply the resizing of a field to all columns.\nThis includes the ability to set a fixed width or to \u0026quot;Autosize\u0026quot; all columns. These actions are available from the attribute table header context menu which is accessible by right-clicking a field header.\nThis feature was developed by Ben Wirf\nFeature: Export/import of authentication configurations made easy ¶ Starting with QGIS 3.20, users can now easily export and import authentication configurations via a pair of actions in QGIS settings' authentication panel. Exported configurations can be password-protected to avoid sensitive information leakage.\nThis greatly eases sharing of various authentication configurations across multiple QGIS users, especially when it comes to more complex configuration methods such as oauth2.\nThis feature was funded by Ville d'Yverdon-les-Bains\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nTemporal ¶ Feature: Temporal navigation steps ¶ A temporal navigation step option for \u0026quot;source timestamps\u0026quot; has been added to the temporal controller. When selected, this causes the temporal navigation to step between all available time ranges from layers in the project. It's useful when a project contains layers with non-contiguous available times, such as a WMS-T service which provides images that are available at irregular dates. This option will allow users to only step between time ranges where the next available image is shown.\nThis feature was funded by Natural resources Canada Contract: 3000720707\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Improved WMS-T settings ¶ WMS-T settings were simplified and controls were introduced to make it easier to select the desired time for some providers.\nChanges were made in order to achieve the following outcomes:\nMake it clearer exactly what each of the settings controls Make the interplay and relationships between the various settings clearer Make it obvious which settings apply, regardless of whether the layer is controlled by the temporal controller or whether the settings relate only to static WMS-T layers For servers that expose a non-contiguous set of date-time instances, instead of a range of dates, a combo box is provided removing the need to manually enter valid dates Example of settings with a server exposing a range of available dates:\nExample of settings with a server exposing a list of available datetime instances only:\nThis feature was funded by Natural resources Canada Contract: 3000720707\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Horizontal mouse wheel temporal navigation ¶ Horizontal scrolling using the mouse wheel (where supported) with the cursor on the map canvas will allow users to navigate, or \u0026quot;scrub\u0026quot;, the temporal navigation slider backwards and forwards\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nMap Tools ¶ Feature: Nominatim Geocoder Integration ¶ The Nominatim Geocoder is now natively integrated into QGIS out of the box! QGIS provides a Nominatim locator filter, as well as the \u0026quot;Batch Nominatim Geocoder\u0026quot; processing tool for batch geocoding locations.\nNominatim locator filter\nThe QGIS locator bar widget (by default, a search bar in the bottom left corner CTRL+K) now supports Nominatim geocode searches by using the prefix '\u0026gt;'.\nUsers may now search for locations using the format \u0026gt; search string in the locator and will be provided with a selection of results. Selecting a search result will reposition the canvas extent on that location.\nBatch Nominatim Geocoder\nIn addition, a new \u0026quot;Batch Nominatim Geocoder\u0026quot; algorithm has been added to the QGIS processing toolbox under Vector tools, allowing users to geocode multiple locations at once.\nNominatim is a geocoding service that utilizes data from the OpenStreetMap project. Usage limitations and rate limits - 1 query per second - do apply in line with the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) usage policies, and the data is provided under the terms of the ODbl license. Additionally, queries to the Nominatim service may include telemetry information.\nShipping this great geocoder service by default would not have been possible without the generosity and participation of the OSMF.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Processing history dialog improvements ¶ The processing's history dialog has had a series of user interface improvements, including regrouping of algorithms in meaningful folder structures and making use of individual algorithm icons. Searching for that algorithm you ran last week has never been as easy!\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Map layer icons in the expression builder dialog ¶ The expression builder dialog now displays map layer icons next to the list of layers under the 'Map Layers' parent group. This speeds up skipping through the list and provides additional context.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: SVG browser filtering ¶ The SVG browser interface now supports simple text-based filtering, allowing users to filter the available SVG images based on a given search string.\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Interpolated line symbol layer type for vector layers ¶ QGIS provides a new \u0026quot;Interpolated Line\u0026quot; symbol layer type, which results in the rendering of a color and/ or width varying line.\nThis symbol is highly configurable and allows users to associate attributes or expressions to each line extremity or curve, amongst other configuration options. Values are interpolated along the line string between extremities. Color is configured with a color ramp shader widget.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec\nFeature: Trim the simple line symbol ¶ An option to trim the start and end of simple line symbols was added, allowing for the line rendering to trim off the first and last sections of a line at a user configured distance. It is useful for creating complex symbols where a line layer should not overlap marker symbol layers placed at the start or end positions of a line feature, such as with transport routes. The trim distance supports a range of units, including a percentage of the overall line length, and can also be configured as a data-defined property.\nA sample gallery of this functionality in use:\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New \u0026quot;Embedded styling\u0026quot; renderer with OGR feature styles support ¶ A new \u0026quot;Embedded styling\u0026quot; renderer has been added which exposes OGR feature styles, allowing QGIS to automatically symbolize data from certain datatypes which have integrated style information, such as KML or TAB files.\nThis feature implements QEP-209\nSupport should extend automatically to all GDAL drivers which implement the OGR feature style API.\nCurrently only supports line symbol conversion, but point and polygon symbol support is under development.\nThis functionality also supports the direct conversion of embedded symbol renderers into categorized or rule-based renderers. This enables QGIS to automatically create categories or rules which define symbology based on the relevant feature IDs:\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Denmark user-group\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New shapes and cap styles for ellipse markers ¶ Several new shapes - semi arc and arrow signs - were added to the ellipse marker symbol layer, as well as a setting to modify the cap style for stroke-only ellipse shapes.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Set cap styles for simple markers ¶ QGIS now allows for the pen cap (or line ending) style to be set for simple marker symbol layers, which is useful for the stroke-only symbols like cross and arrowhead markers, where it's beneficial to allow the use of round caps instead of square caps.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow pen cap style to be set for ellipse marker symbol layers ¶ Ellipse markers now also include support for modifying the pen cap (line ending) styles\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Polygon rings @geometry_ring_num variable ¶ A new variable, @geometry_ring_num, has been added for data-defined styling when rendering polygon rings. The variable is available whenever a polygon outline is being rendered, such as a simple line or marker line. This data-defined property will be set to 0 for the exterior ring, and increment accordingly (1, 2, 3... etc) for successive interior rings.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Fill symbols for label background shields ¶ Label shields can now use fill symbols for the rectangle, square, circle, and ellipse shapes.\nThis extends beyond the previously available ability for these shields to utilize simple fill and stroke and grants the ability to leverage the complete symbology capabilities of QGIS for shield rendering, including the utilization of \u0026quot;saved styles\u0026quot;.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Blending mode settings for label callouts ¶ Label callouts can now leverage the advanced blending modes from QGIS\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Anchor line labels by entire line ¶ In previous versions, when an anchor position for a line label was calculated, QGIS would only consider the visible extent of the feature. This affected the expected label position in some cases, and a new \u0026quot;Use Entire Line\u0026quot; setting allows users to configure the behavior according to their needs, so that the entire feature may be considered before label placement rather than just the portion of a feature that is currently visible.\nThis feature was funded by Stadt Zürich\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Balloon callout corner radius ¶ Balloon callout styles now support rounded corners by introducing a \u0026quot;corner radius\u0026quot; option, resulting in the ability to easily produce visually pleasing designs.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Balloon (speech bubble) callouts ¶ A new \u0026quot;balloon\u0026quot;, or speech bubble, callout style is provided for labels.\nThis feature was funded by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Curved line callout style ¶ A new \u0026quot;Curved Line\u0026quot; callout style has been provided for creating cartographically pleasing curved line callouts between the labels and features\nOptions include:\nSelecting a specific curve orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise) Automatic orientation option which determines optimal orientation for each individual label Control over the amount of curvature applied to the callout lines. This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Highlight pinned callout start or end points ¶ When the \u0026quot;show pinned labels\u0026quot; option is enabled, QGIS will now also highlight any pinned callout start or end points. This allows users to immediately see which callouts points have been manually placed in relation to those that are automatically placed.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Auto-creation of callout auxiliary fields ¶ QGIS now automatically manages the creation of callout auxiliary fields when attempting to move a callout start or end point interactively, making the user experience for moving a callout follow the exact same behavior as that of moving a label, preventing the system from forcing users to create auxillary fields in advance.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Callout snapping ¶ When interactively moving a callout line, holding the shift button will now cause the callout to snap angles at increments of 15 degrees\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Toggle label layers shortcut ¶ A shortcut action to toggle labeling has been added to the context menu of vector layers in the layer panel. This allows for labels to be quickly switched on or off, without losing the label configuration. If a layer has never had labeling configured and the action is checked, then QGIS will attempt to apply a simple labeling configuration to the layer using default parameters.\nThis feature was funded by Natural resources Canada Contract: 3000720707\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Data defined callout start and end points ¶ Label callout lines can now have data-defined starting and ending points, useful for manual control of the exact placement for individual callout lines.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow callouts to be interactively moved using the Move Label tool ¶ This change allows the interactive \u0026quot;Move labels\u0026quot; tool to also move callout endpoints, whenever the callout has data-defined origin or destination fields set.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nPoint Clouds ¶ Feature: Support for remote datasets (EPT) ¶ Point cloud datasets that have been processed to EPT format can be loaded from remote HTTP(S) servers, similar to how raster/vector tiles work. This way, it is possible to access large point cloud datasets without first having to download them as LAS/LAZ files. The EPT format is optimized for tiling and streaming, so QGIS only downloads small amounts of data necessary for display of the current view and resolution. This works in both 2D and 3D view.\nIf you have point cloud datasets in LAS/LAZ format, these can be converted to EPT using Entwine or Untwine (shipped also with QGIS).\nHow to use: in Data Source Manager \u0026gt; Point Cloud tab \u0026gt; select \u0026quot;Protocol\u0026quot; as the source type and enter URL of the dataset (normally ending with \u0026quot;ept.json\u0026quot;).\nYou can test with USGS LiDAR data - just use the link from \u0026quot;EPT\u0026quot; column from one of the datasets. Some example endpoints include:\nChicago Mount Baker Denmark Netherlands AHN2 By the way, every point cloud dataset that QGIS loads is first processed to EPT (look for \u0026quot;ept_XXX\u0026quot; sub-folder where your original data is located), so it is possible to just copy that \u0026quot;ept_XXX\u0026quot; folder to a HTTP(S) server and you are ready to use this feature.\nThis feature was funded by Hobu\nThis feature was developed by Belgacem Nedjima (Lutra Consulting)\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: \u0026quot;Convert to Static Text\u0026quot; option ¶ When using dynamic, or expression-based labels, users may now select the \u0026quot;Convert to Static Text\u0026quot; option which has been added to the dropdown menu next to \u0026quot;Insert/Edit Expression\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;, in the layout label properties widget.\nThis option will evaluate and replace any dynamic parts of a label's contents with their current values.\nThis provides an easy way to convert dynamic labels to static ones, so that users can manually tweak the results when needed.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Improvement to XYZ layers previewed in map items ¶ Handling of XYZ layers previewed in layout map items has been improved to ensure that their tile zoom levels match those of the exported layout while zooming in and out in the layout designer dialog. Users can now more easily refine the placement of their items (labels, legend, images, etc.) against a map preview that better matches the targeted output.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Zug - Amt für Raum und Verkehr (ARV)\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nExpressions ¶ Feature: length3D Function ¶ A \u0026quot;length3D\u0026quot; function has been added for returning the 3D length of a LineGeometry type geometry. This calculates the cartesian 3D length of a geometry line object. If the geometry is not a 3D line object, it returns its 2D length.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Extended array expression functions ¶ The following array expressions were added:\narray_count array_prioritize array_replace This feature was funded by Canton of Luzern\nThis feature was developed by Damiano Lombardi\nFeature: MIME Type expression function ¶ The new mime_type( bytes ) expression function returns the MIME Type, or Media type, of an input bytes object\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Select attributes from the largest geometry when merging ¶ A button to select attributes from the largest geometry has been added to the confirmation dialogue when using the merge features editing tools for polygon and line layers.\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis\nFeature: Streaming digitizing mode ¶ When streaming digitizing mode is active, points are automatically added following the mouse cursor movement, providing a \u0026quot;freehand drawing\u0026quot; type experience.\nUsing the \u0026quot;R\u0026quot; key during digitizing operations will toggle streaming digitizing and normal (or circular string) digitizing.\nWorks with multiple map tools, including creating new line or polygon features, add ring, add part, reshape, split features, split parts, and more.\nThis feature was funded by Natural resources Canada Contract: 3000720707\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New \u0026quot;Line Endpoints\u0026quot; snapping option ¶ When enabled, this snapping mode snaps to the beginning or end vertex of lines only. When snapping to a polygon layer, only the first vertex in rings will be snapped to.\nThis feature was funded by Natural resources Canada Contract: 3000720707\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Select vertices by polygon ¶ Users can now use the ALT button to select vertices by polygon whilst digitizing.\nThis should improve the user experience for selecting specific vertices using the vertex tool, reducing the need for multiple passes using The SHIFT or CTRL functions to add and remove vertices from the current selection.\nThis also reduces the need to creatively rotate the map canvas in order to align vertices for selection, and provides an enhanced editing process such as for selecting the vertices of a curved road along a single side only.\nThis function supports the following usage operations:\nAlt+click using the vertex tool to start digitizing a polygon. Each subsequent click adds a new vertex to the rubberband polygon. Backspace/ delete removes last added rubberband vertex. Esc cancels the polygon selection mode, as does backspace/ deleting all of the rubberband's vertices. Right-click finalizes the polygon digitizing and selects all vertices within the rubberband polygon. This feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis\nData Management ¶ Feature: Layer tree warning icon for layers with CRS inaccuracies ¶ A new \u0026quot;Show CRS accuracy warnings for layers in project legend\u0026quot; is provided which, when checked, will display a new warning icon identifying any layers with a CRS which is identified as having accuracy issues.\nExamples of low-accuracy layers might include those with a dynamic CRS with no coordinate epoch available, or a CRS based on a datum ensemble with accuracy that is found to exceed the user-set limit.\nThis option is disabled by default, and designed for use in engineering, BIM, and other industries where inaccuracies of meter/submeter level are very dangerous.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Basic support for dynamic CRS coordinate epoch ¶ Basic support for the coordinate epoch of dynamic (not plate fixed) CRS has been added in line with relevant updates to GDAL.\nQGIS has added support for respecting the source or destination coordinate epoch when transforming to or from a dynamic CRS.\nIf a dynamic CRS to dynamic CRS transformation at different epochs is attempted, which is not currently supported by PROJ, a user-facing warning message will be shown advising them that the results may be misleading and should not be used for high accuracy work.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Projection information improvements ¶ Various improvements have been made to the handling and representation of projection information in QGIS, including:\nThe addition of an API to retrieve PROJ operation details for CRSes The ability to show extended information about a layer's CRS in the layer properties info tab, including accuracy warnings The addition of a @map_crs_projection variable, for retrieving a friendly name of a map's projection (e.g. \u0026quot;Albers Equal Area\u0026quot;) This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Datum ensemble CRS warnings ¶ QGIS now shows a warning in the projection selection widget when a CRS based on a datum ensemble is selected, warning the user that there's an inherent lack of accuracy in the selected CRS.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Persist layer metadata in vector file exports ¶ A \u0026quot;persist layer metadata\u0026quot; checkbox has been added to the export vector file dialog. When checked, any layer metadata present in the source layer will be copied and stored in the destination file.\nThis functionality is enabled by default and ensures that metadata is properly transferred over to newly created items, which is especially effective when utilizing the GPKG format.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Layer notes ¶ QGIS now supports \u0026quot;layer notes\u0026quot;, which can be created via the \u0026quot;Add Layer Notes\u0026quot; action in the layer context menu.\nThese notes are saved per layer, per project. They can be used as a place to store important messages for project users, such as to-do lists, processing or management instructions, or any other arbitrary text-based metadata.\nA notepad indicator icon in the layers panel identifies layers that have notes attached. Clicking the notes indicator icon will open the note for editing.\nThis feature was discussed in QEP-206\nThese notes may be copied and pasted using the traditional copy/ paste methodology for transferring styles between layers in QGIS.\nLayer notes are also supported by and stored within QML (QGIS Style) and QLR (QGIS Layer Definition) files.\nThis feature was funded by Alta Ehf\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Automatically load .shp.xml metadata ¶ QGIS will now automatically load and convert ESRI metadata stored using a .shp.xml sidecar file. Where shapefile data is loaded and these metadata files are present they will be loaded automatically, with available layer metadata populated accordingly.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Automatically translate layer data from ESRI Filegeodatabases to QGIS layer metadata ¶ When loading data from a .gdb file, QGIS will automatically attempt to translate as much as possible of the original ESRI metadata across to the QGIS metadata, so that it's immediately available for use.\nThis feature was funded by North Road / SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Read field domains from datasets ¶ For formats that support the embedded definition of field domains (currently GPKG and GDB), QGIS automatically converts the embedded field domain over to the equivalent QGIS editor configuration for the field.\nThis means that GPKG/GDB with coded field domains will automatically load into QGIS with their correct Value Map widget configuration intact, so that users see descriptions for field values instead of raw codes. Fields with a range (min/max) type domain will be translated to the range widget for the field as well.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow loading GPKG layers with GEOMETRY type ¶ GeoPackage supports layers with a generic \u0026quot;geometry\u0026quot; type, with the QGIS release 3.20 it is now possible to load them and specify the requested geometry type on load, just like with PostGIS.\nThis feature was developed by Marco Bernasocchi (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Offline editing support for string list and number list field types ¶ PostGIS users rejoice: offline editing got a bit smarter and can now handle string list and number list field types.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Per-field usage of last values for newly created features ¶ Extended control has been provided for whether the last entered field values should be reused when creating new features, as this functionality may now be controlled independently for each individual attribute field for each layer.\nHistorically this functionality was configured using a global option that causes ALL field values for ALL layers to be remembered and reused during a QGIS session when creating new features.\nThis allows for finer control over form behavior, where some values may be desirable to reuse but others should be cleared or set to a default value based on an expression.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: JSON View widget ¶ New view widget to display JSON data in a user friendly way. Data can be displayed as syntax highlighted text or as a tree.\nThis feature was funded by Canton of Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Damiano Lombardi\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: Vector \u0026quot;label\u0026quot; legend entries ¶ QGIS now supports adding legend entries for layer labels, which will display the font style and labeling classes for vector features.\nThis provides a legend entry that allows users to explicitly identify features by label style, even when no feature symbology is used.\nControl of this behavior is made accessible by adding a \u0026quot;show label legend\u0026quot; option to the legend tab of the vector layer properties.\nThis feature was funded by Canton of Glarus\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Add option to save layer metadata to Package Layers algorithm ¶ This additional option enriches the Package Layers algorithm and will copy the source layer metadata into the geopackage, so that it will be used as the default metadata for the layer.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Raster Layer Properties Algorithm ¶ This algorithm retrieves basic raster layer properties such as the size in pixels, pixel dimensions (map units per pixel), number of bands, and no data value.\nIt is intended for use as a means of extracting these useful properties to use as the input values to other algorithms in a model, such as passing an existing raster's pixel sizes over to a GDAL raster algorithm.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Improved rasterize operation with 3D support ¶ The rasterize (vector to raster) GDAL process now supports 3D data, in that it now includes the possibility to use the Z value (elevation) of a feature to extract burn values.\nThe use of this option indicates that a burn value should be extracted from the \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; values of the feature. Works with points and lines (linear interpolation along each segment). For polygons, it only works properly if the features are flat (i.e. contain the same Z value for all vertices)\nThis feature was developed by talledodiego\nFeature: Save selected option for Package Layers Algorithm ¶ The Package Layers Algorithm was modified to support saving only selected features\nThis feature was developed by Stefan Conrads\nFeature: Log levels for processing context ¶ A new log level property has been added to QgsProcessingContext\nThis allows algorithms to tune their output based on the logging level.\nThe qgis_process command line operation has been granted a --verbose switch to enable verbose log output.\nThis feature was funded by Natural resources Canada Contract: 3000720411\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Geometry snapper rework offers major speed boost ¶ This development cycle saw a rework of the inner workings of QGIS' geometry snapper algorithm, which has led to a significant speed boost. Datasets which could take over 10 minutes to process now take less than 10 seconds.\nThis feature was funded by SwissTierras Colombia\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Add a last_value function to the aggregate algorithm ¶ The aggregate processing tool now includes a last_value aggregation function, which is especially useful when working with input data that has meaningful ordering.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Add global option to disable monitoring of directories ¶ Allows users to manually opt-out of monitoring directories in the browser by default, and also provides a mechanism for enterprise installs to disable this potentially unwanted behavior.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: APIs for export and import of XML authentication configurations ¶ QGIS now provides export and import functions to the QGIS authentication manager. This functionality has not yet been exposed through the User Interface. Complex authentication configurations with numerous, such as OAuth2, can optionally be encrypted or stored in plain text to enhance authentication management workflows.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Custom icon colors for folders in browser ¶ QGIS now allows users to set a custom icon color for different folders in the browser. This effectively allows users to \u0026quot;tag\u0026quot; folders, which aids in the rapid navigation of complex folder structures in the browser.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: OWS Group removed from the QGIS Browser ¶ The non-functional and redundant \u0026quot;OWS\u0026quot; Group has been removed from the QGIS Browser panel.\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Add support for integer, real and integer64 list data types in OGR ¶ Additional list field types have been added to the OGR driver for supported data types, such as Geojson.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Extend vector layer read capabilities to other layer types ¶ Whilst the ability for QGIS to access a layer's metadata information, such as reading the extent of a layer from the metadata, was previously restricted to vector layers, this functionality has now been extended to include various other layer types including raster, point cloud, and others.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by rldhont\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: External layer opacity ¶ Opacity control support for external/ remote layers served by QGIS Server\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nFeature: Configurable Service URL ¶ Additional options have been added to QGIS Server to improve the results of the GetCapabilities response, especially without the need to complete various fields within the QGIS Project configuration. These updates also enable many options to be set by an environment variable, or by providing headers from a proxy.\nThe following options have been added and will be resolved by the server in the following order:\nValue defined in the project per service. The \u0026lt;service\u0026gt;_SERVICE_URL environment variable. The SERVICE_URL environment variable. The custom X-Qgis-\u0026lt;service\u0026gt;-Service-Url header. The custom X-Qgis-Service-Url header. Build from the standard Forwarded header. Build from the pseudo standard X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Proto headers. Build from the standard Host header and the server protocol. Build from the server name and the server protocol.

Białowieża Forest is one of the world\u0026rsquo;s last primary woodlands, located on the border between Poland and Belarus. It is one of the few natural old-growth forests in temperate lowland Europe and has been protected for over 600 years. The outstanding value of Białowieża Forest has been acknowledged by its recognition as a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site.\nBiałowieża Forest is named after the village Białowieża, which is located right in the middle of this woodland. It is one of the oldest settlements in the area, nowadays hosting numerous research and tourism activities. Today, there are three research institutions in the village: Białowieża Geobotanical Station, University of Warsaw, The Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, and the Forest Research Institute, Department of Natural Forests. Additionally, a large number of scientists from Poland and abroad travel to Białowieża in order to carry out their studies, and as such, there are also other users of QGIS in the area, as well as additional projects which contribute to the Open Data and Open Source Software ecosystems, such as the Open Forest Data project.\nYou can learn more about the project and this release of QGIS at the dedicated project website, https://qgisbialowieza.pl.\nThis feature-packed release includes a vast number of user experience enhancements and controls added to various advanced functionalities. In addition to a host of additional mesh functionality and operational improvements, QGIS Desktop now includes annotation tools and support for annotation layers, amongst much, much more. For a whirlwind tour of all the new functionalities introduced, you can view the highlight reel video at https://youtu.be/U-RHBt6WZi8\nWe would also like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and all the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible.

The user interactions follow the standard QGIS patterns as follows:\nLeft click to start the move Second left click to apply changes Right-click to cancel Selecting a node and pressing delete will remove the node Double clicking a segment will add a node This feature was funded by the Swiss QGIS user group.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Move selected annotation with cursor keys ¶ When an annotation item is selected it can be moved by pressing the cursor keys.\nThis functionality includes the ability to use keyboard shortcuts in a manner that follows the same interaction pattern as used with layout items:\nshift + cursor: Big movement alt + cursor: 1px movement This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Create line/ polygon annotation item tools ¶ Functions for creating new line and polygon annotation items have been added to the annotation tools.\nThese support the same interactions as drawing vector features, such as snapping, tracing, cad dock, backspace to remove vertices, curve and stream digitizing modes, and others.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Swiss User Group\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New point text tool ¶ A framework has been created for map tools to create new annotation items, including the ability to create new point text annotation items.\nThis feature was funded by the Swiss QGIS user group\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Annotations toolbar ¶ A new annotations toolbar has been added which provides actions for the following:\nCreate a new empty annotation layer in the current project. The \u0026quot;Modify Annotations\u0026quot; tool, which provides an interface for editing existing annotations. The supported operations for the modify annotations feature include:\nClicking on an existing annotation to select it to shows its properties in the layer styling dock, including symbol, reference scale, z index, etc/ Left click on a selected annotation item to start moving it. A right click or escape cancels the move, while a second left click will confirm the move. Pressing the delete key while an annotation is selected will delete that annotation This feature was funded by the Swiss QGIS User group\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nMap Tools ¶ Feature: Add a \u0026quot;measure bearing\u0026quot; map tool ¶ This tool behaves similarly to the existing \u0026quot;measure angle\u0026quot; map tool, but requires the user only to click two points on the map and displays the bearing between these points.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Toggle editing on multiple selected layers ¶ The toggle editing action has been modified to support activation on all selected layers, making it easy to start and stop editing sessions across multiple layers simultaneously. Although the editing session status for all selected layers may not be the same, all selected layers will be toggled to an active or inactive state as the inverse of the current state of the currently active layer. This functionality is applied to the menu item Layer \u0026gt; Toggle Editing, the Toggle Editing button on the digitizing toolbar, and the Toggle Editing entry in the layers context menu.\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis\nFeature: Identify layer groups and all selected layers ¶ Whilst the identify features tool supported multiple selection modes, the \u0026quot;current layer\u0026quot; mode has been extended to support the selection of layer groups, and will identify features from all selected layers. Only features from visible layers within a layer group will be identified.\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis\nFeature: Add a 'Show in Files' action for all file items in browser ¶ Opens a file explorer window and directly selects the file\nAlso fixes the existing \u0026quot;File Properties\u0026quot; action so that it shows regardless of the file type, and doesn't show incorrectly in some circumstances.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Custom units for geometry generator symbol layers ¶ Geometry generators now expose an option for users to select which units should be used for returning geometries in, rather than only supporting the units defined in the layer CRS. This is especially useful in situations where the symbol is not associated with a layer, such as when used in layout items.\nThe update provides the following unit choices:\nMap units (the default, previous behavior) Millimeters Pixels Inches Points When millimeters, pixels, inches or points are selected, then the @map_geometry variable will be available for use within the expression, containing the feature geometry in the specified units (relative to the map frame), whilst the $geometry variable remains available within the expression in the layer CRS map units.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Symbology reference scale for vector layers ¶ An option has been exposed that allows the configuration of reference scales for feature symbologies on vector layers.\nIn practice, this defines the relevant map scale at which the configured symbology and label sizes may be referenced with paper-based units, such as millimeters or points. These unit sizes will then be automatically scaled accordingly, based on the ratio of the relevant reference scale and the scale of the current map view.\nFor instance, where a line layer is configured to use a 2mm wide line using a reference scale of 1:2000, the feature would be rendered using 4mm wide lines at a map scale of 1:1000, or 1mm with a map scale of 1:4000.\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Invert colors filter option for raster rendering ¶ It is now possible to invert the colors of a raster being rendered via a new invert colors option. This can come in handy on a number of occasions. For example, a light raster base map can quickly be turned into a dark base map without the need to recreate a new raster dataset.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Specify unit for data defined label rotation ¶ Specify the angle unit for data defined label rotation\nThis feature was developed by Damiano Lombardi\nMesh ¶ Feature: Create new mesh layer ¶ QGIS now supports the creation of new mesh layers.\nThe mesh creation supports the following creation formats:\nNew empty mesh layer New mesh frame based on an existing mesh within the project New mesh frame based on an existing mesh from a file This feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Mesh frame editing ¶ QGIS now supports mesh frame editing, which supports the ability to ensure mesh consistency and provides the ability to undo and redo edit operations.\nThis introduces the QgsMeshEditor class to the QGIS Python API, which allows for performing edit operations, and the QgsTopologicalMesh class which is not exposed to the Python API but is used for ensuring that edited mesh elements remain topologically correct and perform data modifications.\nThis feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Mesh frame editing lifecycle ¶ This feature has been introduced in the scope of QEP 228 which outlines the introduction of Mesh Editing tools, implements changes to the User Interface, and exposes new functionality to the API.\nMesh frame editing now supports a complete set of functionalities for controlling the editing lifecycle operations, including start, commit, roll back, and cancel, similar to vector layers.\nThis feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Edit mesh map tool ¶ This feature has been introduced in the scope of QEP 228 which outlines the introduction of Mesh Editing tools.\nMesh editing map tool now supports the following operations:\nAdd vertices/ faces Select vertices/ faces Remove vertices/ faces Change the Z values of vertices Move vertices Interaction with edges Split faces This feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Advanced mesh editing enhancements ¶ This feature has been introduced in the scope of QEP 228 which outlines the introduction of Mesh Editing tools, implements changes to the User Interface, and exposes new functionality to the API.\nThe QGIS User Interface provides delaunay triangulation and face refinement functions, which are accessible from the context menu in the map when vertices and/ or faces are selected from a mesh layer. These options may be migrated to buttons in the mesh toolbar once further functionality has been introduced.\nThe QGIS API has also been extended to support advanced editing for meshes, which is introduced by a new interface abstract class QgsMeshAdvancedEditing. Derived classes of this class can be implemented to make some advanced editing on a mesh: generation of faces to add to the mesh, particular operation on many faces or vertices. The advanced editing is made by passing a QgsMeshAdvancedEditing instance to a QgsmeshEditor instance, and the editing is applied as other editing operations.\nTwo advanced editing functions are implemented within this feature:\nDelaunay triangulation Faces refinement This feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Select editable mesh elements by polygon ¶ Users can now select mesh elements within a digitized area when performing mesh editing. Each vertex of the polygon is digitized using a left click, whilst right clicking will complete and validate the polygon to select intersecting mesh elements (faces and vertices). Using the backspace key will allow the user to remove last vertex, and the Escape key will allow users to return to the normal digitizing mode.\nThis function supports two behavior modes with different selection predicates as follows:\nTouching elements (default), or partially included/ intersecting elements will be selected (green rubber band). Contained, or completely included elements will be selected (blue rubber band). This feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Select mesh elements by existing geometries ¶ Two actions have been added for selecting mesh elements from geometries present in existing vector layers.\nAfter selecting vector layer geometries, the user can use these tools to select mesh elements using the touching or containing predicates.\nThis feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Select mesh elements by expression ¶ An interface has been created for selecting mesh elements by expression during mesh editing. In addition, a contextual expression function $face_area has been added that returns the area of a mesh face.\nThis feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Transform single vertex ¶ A new editing mode for the mesh transform tool allows the user to import the coordinates of a single selected vertex.\nThe tool button on the top right of the Transform Mesh Vertices window toggles this mode, and each time a single vertex is selected it will automatically populate the available fields for the user to adjust the vertex coordinates accordingly.\nThis feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Reindex/ renumber mesh layer ¶ Users are now able to reindex (or renumber) the vertices and faces of a mesh layer during editing. The renumbering is an optimization of the mesh with the Cuthill-McKee algorithm.\nThis feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Force mesh by polylines ¶ When editing mesh features, users can now transform features by forcing them to conform to a surface defined by existing polylines, or break lines. Faces are forced to follow the break lines, that is, edges of encountered faces have to be on these lines. Users may select break line geometries and then use the dedicated button to transform intersecting mesh elements.\nOptions provided for the transform include:\nAdding new vertices when the lines cut the internal edges Interpolating the Z value of newly added vertices on the mesh or from the lines Tolerance setting for shifting existing vertices into place and preventing the creation of new vertices along line within the specified distance Whilst the term \u0026quot;break lines\u0026quot; is typically used to refer to polylines that constrain a surface or TIN to the defined positions, these break lines are often components of the mesh itself, and additional operations would continue to constrain the surface to these lines. This functionality specifically transforms the surface in a static manner, so that future operations are not constrained to the lines used to transform the mesh elements.\nThis feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Mesh transform by expression ¶ User can perform geometrical transformations on a mesh using an expression to change the vertices' coordinates. All coordinates (X,Y,Z) of selected vertices can be calculated with an expression, allowing transformation of the mesh while the mesh is still valid.\nWith a valid expression, selecting the \u0026quot;Preview transform\u0026quot; option will calculate the new expression based mesh coordinates and identify whether the transform is valid and may be applied.\nIf the preview is green, the transformed mesh is valid and the user can apply the transformation. If the preview is red, the transformed mesh is invalid and user cannot apply the transformation.\nOnce applied, users have the option to undo or redo the operation.\nThis feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nRendering ¶ Feature: Allow using physical DPI for map canvas ¶ A new setting has been made available for correctly using the physical screen DPI instead of logical DPI, allowing symbols to be rendered equally on different attached devices (hi dpi and low dpi), and in mobile applications such as QField.\nThis setting is disabled by default to ensure that symbols are not scaled differently than they were in previous versions of QGIS.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Data defined raster layer opacity ¶ A new control has been exposed which allows the opacity of a raster to be data defined. This allows for the varied representation of a raster layer, in various contexts, such as on different pages of an atlas, being dependent on the visibility of another layer, or adjusted by temporal variables etc.\nAdditionally, a \u0026quot;redraw layer only\u0026quot; temporal mode for raster layers has been added, which causes a raster layer to be redrawn on each new animation frame as in the equivalent functionality for vector layers. This may be useful in many contexts, such as when the layer uses time-based expression values like the data defined renderer opacity to fade in or out a raster layer from an animation.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Predefined scale support for point-driven atlases ¶ Layout map items gained support for the predefined scale mode when controlled by point-driven atlases. This ensures the correct behavior is observed when atlas features are multipoint geometries with varying envelope areas.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Indentation of legend groups and subgroups ¶ Two new entries have been added to the \u0026quot;Spacing\u0026quot; section of the Legend properties:\nIndent of group items Indent of subgroup items Items belonging to groups or subgroups will be shifted right by the specified amount. When legend patches are added to the left of entries they will be indented as well.\nThis feature was developed by Jürnjakob Dugge\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Mesh expression functions for vertex_as_point and vertex_z ¶ Expressions have been added for interacting with mesh layers, with the following functions returning value related to the current vertex:\n$vertex_as_point: returns the current vertex as a geometry point $vertex_z: returns the Z value of the current vertex. These two functions are contextual and need to be added in a QgsExpressionContext with QgsExpressionContextUtils::meshExpressionScope() for the creation of a specific QgsExpressionScope.\nThis feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Expression function for $z ¶ The z value for the current feature in an expression context can now be retrieved using $z\nThis feature was funded by Hydrotec\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Affine transform expression ¶ An affine_transform function has been added to QGIS Expressions.\nThis feature was developed by Antoine Facchini\nFeature: Straight distance2d expression ¶ A straight_distance2d function is now available in QGIS expressions for retrieving the direct/ Euclidean distance between the first and last vertex of a curve geometry feature.\nThis feature was developed by Antoine Facchini\nFeature: Add sinuosity expression ¶ A sinuosity function has been added to QGIS expressions.\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti\nFeature: New exif() and exif_geotag() functions ¶ A new pair of functions was added to the QGIS expression engine to read exif tags from image files. The two functions are:\nexif(path, tag) : this function returns the value of a given tag string for the provided image file path; when the second optional parameter isn't provided, the function will return a map object containing all exif tags and their values. exif_geotag(path) : this function returns a point geometry from the exif geotags containing in the provided image file path. This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Geometry snapper algorithm optimization ¶ The geometry snapper is now blazingly fast after benefiting from another round of optimization work. Small snapping distance values hanging QGIS forever is now a thing of the past.\nThis feature was funded by SwissTierras Colombia\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Convert to curve with vertex tool ¶ The ability to convert vertices to or from curved vertices is now supported with the Vertex tool, allowing users to convert vertices with the \u0026quot;C\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;O\u0026quot; keys.\nAdditionally, methods for convertVertex() have been introduced for the QgsGeometry and QgsCompoundCurve objects in the QGIS API.\nThis feature was funded by Swiss QGIS user group\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang\nFeature: Add Z/M support to Advanced Digitizing ¶ The QGIS Advanced Digitizing tools now support the entering of user-defined Z and M values, greatly improving the available control for newly digitized features such as components of 3D networks.\nThis feature was funded by Métropole Européenne de Lille @Jean-Roc\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti\nData Management ¶ Feature: Drag and Drop support for external storage file widget ¶ Users may now use Drag and Drop support on an external resource widget when an external storage has been defined and configured appropriately.\nThis feature was funded by Lille Metropole\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces\nFeature: File-based dataset size and last modified date in the layer properties dialog ¶ The layer properties dialog's information panel now shows the size and last modified date of file-based datasets, removing the need to retrieve these details from a file manager. These additional details are also visible in the browser panel's information section. For datasets formed of more than a single file, the size will reflect the sum of all the auxiliary/ sidecar files forming the dataset.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Rename files in QGIS Browser ¶ A rename action has been added to the manage submenu for files in the QGIS browser. If the renamed file corresponds to a spatial dataset with multiple auxiliary/ sidecar files, then these will be renamed accordingly.\nAdditionally, users are warned if the file is a layer which exists in the current project and are asked whether they want to automatically update all the layer paths accordingly.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Move GPS tools \u0026quot;add gpx layer\u0026quot; functionality to Data Source Manager ¶ Functionality from the GPS tools plugin to add GPX layers has been moved to a new \u0026quot;Add GPS Data\u0026quot; page in the data source manager.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Load projects from GPKG using drag and drop ¶ Historically, when using drag and drop functionality with the GPKG format, only feature layers were represented to load into QGIS.\nQGIS will now show projects embedded in a GPKG when the GPKG file is added to the QGIS canvas using the drag and drop functionality.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: External Storage support ¶ QGIS now includes an External Storage API, in line with the proposal outlined in QEP 196.\nThe implementation includes the following features:\nExternal storage API Registry that contains all external storage backends SimpleCopy external storage that stores the selected external resource on a specific location on disk WebDAV support In addition, a widget has been added to allow for the configuration and visualization of external storage backends and components. The storage mode (File or Directory) widget is not currently visible when an external storage is selected, and relative path settings are hidden as relative paths are not relevant to external storage data.\nThis feature was funded by Lille Metropole\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Drag \u0026amp; Drop designer form actions ¶ Layer actions are now available in forms using the drag and drop designer\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn, Amt für Geoinformation\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: Use placeholder icon in legend for raster layers ¶ A new feature has been added to allow the selection of a placeholder image which may be used in the legend item of a raster or vector layer. This is very useful in certain instances such as when using raster layers with QGIS server, preventing long lists of palleted values from GetLegendGraphic requests and instead returning a tailored result, among various other use cases.\nThis feature was funded by Canton of Glarus\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: Add if() function to raster calculator ¶ A long awaited feature has been for QGIS to support simple if() statements in the raster calculator.\nAlthough conditional statements have been supported in the raster calculator for a while, the syntax and structure of the expressions was often verbose and complex.\nThe raster calculator will now support simple conditional statements with the common syntax of if ( condition , option1 , option2 ) whereby if the condition evaluates to true, the first option will be used, otherwise the second option will be used.\nThis feature was developed by Francesco Bursi\nFeature: Virtual raster support in raster calculator ¶ Virtual raster data provider support has been added to the QGIS raster calculator, which now allows users to perform raster calculator operations without specifying an output file or writing the resulting raster to disk.\nThis option is enabled via the UI by checking the \u0026quot;Create on-the-fly raster instead of writing layer to disk\u0026quot; checkbox in the raster calculator, and is also supported via the PyQgis API.\nResulting raster layers may be used in further analysis operations and allow for user specified raster names. Where a name is not provided for the resulting raster, it will be named according to the formula used to generate it.\nThis feature was developed by Francesco Bursi\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Annotation layer parameter type for processing ¶ An annotation layer parameter type has been added to the QGIS Processing Framework, which includes a new algorithm for converting main annotation layer items to secondary annotation layers. This is useful for moving items created in the main layer to a secondary layer, so that the item placement can be adjusted within the layer stack.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add a POST option to the FileDownloader processing algorithm ¶ Add a choice between performing GET or POST requests when downloading a file using the FileDownloader processing tool.\nIf the POST parameter is specified, some DATA can be added in the query.\nThis is useful in many contexts, such as for sending longer requests to the Overpass API using POST to download OSM data.\nThis feature was funded by 3Liz\nThis feature was developed by Étienne Trimaille\nFeature: Add new \u0026quot;Select within distance\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Extract within distance\u0026quot; algorithms ¶ New algorithms have been provided which allow users to select or extract features from one layer which are within a certain distance of features from another reference layer.\nThe distance checking is heavily optimized, using spatial indices to restrict the number of features retrieved, and also automatically handling off the check to the database server for layers using the PostGIS provider.\nAdditionally, the distance parameter may be a data-defined. property\nThis feature was funded by QTIBIA Engineering\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Point cloud parameter for Processing ¶ A new point cloud parameter has been added to the QGIS Processing. Framework. this allows for the filtering of point cloud layers in the map layer and multiple layers parameters. This opens the door for native point cloud algorithms and improves point cloud support for 3rd party providers.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Remove the GPS importer plugin ¶ The last of the GPS tools functionality has been ported to three new processing algorithms, namely:\nConvert GPS data Upload GPS data to device Download GPS data from device As a result, the GPS importer plugin has been made redundant and has been completely removed from QGIS.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Convert GPX feature type processing algorithm ¶ The Convert GPX feature type tool has been ported from the GPS tools to a new processing algorithm, which uses the GPSBabel tool to convert GPX features from one type to another (e.g. converting all waypoint features to a route feature).\nIt is designed as a drop-in replacement for workflows which previously used this functionality from the GPS tools plugin, but with all the benefits and improvements that come automatically from being a part of of the QGIS Processing Framework.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add incremental field with modulo option ¶ This algorithm allows the user to add a column with an integer that will be incremented from START to the limit, with the possibility of grouping to resume at the value of START following the group.\nAn option called \u0026quot;modulo counter\u0026quot; is included which will reset the counter to the starting value if the modulo value is reached. Using a value of 0 for the modulo option will disable it.\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti\nFeature: Duration parameter ¶ A brand new duration parameter was added to the processing framework to facilitate the creation of temporal-related algorithms.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Spatiotemporal ST-DBSCAN clustering algorithm ¶ QGIS 3.22 ships with a brand new spatiotemporal ST-DBSCAN clustering algorithm which clusters point features based on a 2D implementation of spatiotemporal density-based clustering of applications with noise (ST-DBSCAN) algorithm.\nFor more details, please see the following papers:\nEster, M., H. P. Kriegel, J. Sander, and X. Xu, \u0026quot;A Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise\u0026quot;. In: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Portland, OR, AAAI Press, pp. 226-231. 1996 Birant, Derya, and Alp Kut. \u0026quot;ST-DBSCAN: An algorithm for clustering spatial\u0026ndash;temporal data.\u0026quot; Data \u0026amp; Knowledge Engineering 60.1 (2007): 208-221. Peca, I., Fuchs, G., Vrotsou, K., Andrienko, N. V., \u0026amp; Andrienko, G. L. (2012). Scalable Cluster Analysis of Spatial Events. In EuroVA@ EuroVis. This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Move non-native processing providers into independent plugins ¶ In line with the discussion in QEP 226, the SAGA, GRASS, and OTB providers have been separated into independent plugins.\nThis should prevent issues with the loading of the Processing plugin in cases where any one of these providers is broken. It will also make it easier to convert them into third-party plugins in the future.\nThe SAGA and GRASS plugins are enabled by default, leaving the UX unchanged. The OTB provider can be enabled in the Plugin Manager if necessary, however, the enabling or disabling of any of these providers is now performed via the Plugin Manager as with any other plugin.\nThis is mostly an internal change, with the only visible change on the part of end-users being that the Plugin Manager is used to activate or deactivate the SAGA, GRASS, and OTB providers.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Export all keyboard shortcuts to XML or PDF ¶ Historically, when exporting keyboard shortcuts to an XML file, QGIS would only export user-defined shortcuts. In instances where no customized shortcuts were found, an empty file would be created.\nA new option has been provided to export all available keyboard shortcuts to the resulting XML file, or to generate a PDF output with a list of all defined QGIS shortcuts.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Move GPS Tools GPSbabel device configuration widget to global settings ¶ The GPS babel configuration settings has been moved from a settings page in the deprecated GPS Tools plugin, to a new page in the main settings dialog.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Set default path structure for new projects ¶ QGIS Desktop historically supported the definition of whether a particular project used an absolute or relative structure from the project properties, however, the default setting for this functionality was always configured to use relative paths.\nA new setting has been exposed which allows users to set the default path structure to use either absolute or relative for new projects under the program options. In much the same way the default project format may be configured to use qgz or qgs, this is made available as a global property specific to each user profile.\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nFeature: Allow configuration of the max cache size from QGIS settings ¶ In the qgis_global_settings.ini file, it's possible to set the max image cache size in bytes.\nThe cache is used for caching symbology and layout images, If high resolution images are used for printing layout, then this value should be increased accordingly.\nDefault value is 100mb.\nThis feature was funded by 3Liz\nThis feature was developed by David Marteau\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Improved delete action for browser files ¶ The delete action used from the QGIS browser has been improved in various ways, including:\nThe action is more consistent and applied to all file type items Multiple file deletion is now supported by selecting multiple file items in the browser which includes a confirmation prompt Before deleting files, the current project is scanned to see if it is using any of the files. If so, a prompt is shown asking users if they want to cancel the deletion, or delete and remove layers, or delete and retain layers. This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Connections API result widget ¶ As a part of the ongoing efforts to port the table management functionalities from the DB Manager to the QGIS Browser, as detailed in QEP 205, a new SQL dialog is available from the browser panel which provides the ability to execute queries and SQL statements for the following elements:\nDB connections Schema items Table items The implementation also supports the following advanced functionalities:\nA multi-threaded implementation for both API token fetching and row fetching results in non-blocking GUI operations Fully interruptible API Support for progressive loading of features in the results view (fetchMore API) This feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Transactions in MSSQL provider ¶ Addition of transaction support to the MSSQL data provider.\nThere are no GUI-related changes, as users can enable transactional editing as with other providers. This is done by going to the Project Properties and checking \u0026quot;Automatically create transaction groups where possible\u0026quot; in the Data Sources tab.\nBy default, a running transaction in MSSQL will block other clients from accessing the same data. For example, if one client starts a transaction and adds or modifies a feature in a table, other clients will get blocked when trying to read any data from the table until the transaction is completed.\nThere is database-level configuration option, READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT, which is OFF by default.\nActivating this will change the behavior to function in a similar fashion as other RDBMS systems such as PostgreSQL, in that transactions do not cause blocking and enables the database to support multiple versions of data. This is a database-level property configured by the administrator and can not be automatically set by QGIS when connecting to the database, however it may be activated using the following query:\nALTER DATABASE my_db SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON In most instances where transactions are desired, activating this option is likely recommended to prevent freezing in QGIS or other clients.\nThis feature was funded by ms.GIS\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Martin Dobias)\nFeature: Show system and internal tables in sublayer selection ¶ A check box has been added to the sublayer selection dialog to control whether system and internal tables should be shown. This will be turned off by default, but will be useful in instances where users have a particular need to load a system table into QGIS for viewing or manipulation purposes.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Automatically read and convert metadata from ESRI Personal Geodatabases ¶ Previously this was supported for File Geodatabases and shp.xml metadata, but it is now also supported for ESRI personal geodatabases (.mdb files)\nRequires GDAL 3.4+\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Create a generic data item provider for all file based datasources ¶ This provider uses the QgsProviderRegistry::querySublayers API to automatically create appropriate browser data items for all file based sources, regardless of the underlying provider whether it may be mdal, gdal, ogr, pdal, or ept.\nThis allows the merging of sources which can be handled by multiple different providers into single container items in the browser, which may be expanded to display all related or nested elements. It is common for many file types, such as GeoPDF or KML/KMZ files to may contain raster and vector layers, or .nc files which may be accessed as a mesh or raster depending on the data provider.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Enable multiple MetadataUrls ¶ QGIS Server historically only supported the provision of a single metadata URL, but will now allow multiple metadata endpoints to be specified in the service definition.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by Étienne Trimaille\nFeature: Add version to QGIS Server CLI tools ¶ It's quite a common practice to have arguments like -v and --version for tools accessed via command line interfaces (CLIs), so new --version and it's alias -v have been added to identify QGIS version information for the following tools:\nqgis_process qgis_mapserv.fcgi qgis_mapserver This feature was funded by 3Liz\nThis feature was developed by Étienne Trimaille\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Expose scriptable vector tile encoder ¶ An additional writeSingleTile method in QgsVectorTileWriter has been exposed to enable the encoding of a single vector tile to a memory buffer. This may support workflows for PyQgis and QGIS Server which include support for vector tiles.\nThis feature was developed by David Marteau\nFeature: Encode and write vector tiles in different CRS than EPSG:3857 ¶ The QGIS API has been extended to support encoding and writing vector tiles in a different CRS than EPSG:3857.\nNote that according to the Mapbox Vector Tile specification, a Vector Tile represents data based on a square extent within a projection. A Vector Tile should contain information about its bounds and projection. The file format assumes that the decoder knows the bounds and projection of a Vector Tile before decoding it.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by rldhont\nFeature: DistanceWithin filter for QgsFeatureRequest ¶ An option has been added to QgsFeatureRequest to request features within a certain distance of a reference geometry\nThis is made possible by the new enum Qgis::SpatialFilterType which has been added to reflect whether a request uses no spatial filter, a BoundingBox filter (via setFilterRect), or the new DistanceWithin filter.\nFor example, the following request will retrieve all features within 50 map units of the provided linestring:\nQgsFeatureRequest().setDistanceWithin(QgsGeometry.fromWkt(\u0026#39;LineString(0 0, 10 0, 12 1)\u0026#39;), 50) Distance within filters are treated like bounding box filters, in that they are independent of any attribute/id filters (such as feature ids or expressions).\nProvider feature iterators can potentially delegate the distance within search to the backend. So, for example, the PostgreSQL data provider could use an ST_DWithin query for optimal index use.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: API for preset combobox values ¶ An API has been added to allow a string parameter to show as a combobox with preset choices in processing GUI tools.\nIn some circumstances, it is desirable to restrict the values available when a user is asked to enter a string parameter that should match a list of predetermined \u0026quot;valid\u0026quot; values, yet these values will vary installation by installation.\nFor example, a \u0026quot;printer name\u0026quot; parameter, where it may be desired that users may pick a name value from a list of printers installed on the system, but since the printer names will vary between installations, an enum parameter is not a suitable choice.\nThis is now supported by setting the \u0026quot;value_hints\u0026quot; option in the widget wrapper metadata, as demonstrated below.\nWhilst this provides a mechanism for guiding users to select from valid string values when running a Processing algorithm through the GUI, it does not place any limits on the string values accepted via PyQGIS codes or when running the algorithm via other means that do not use the GUI. Algorithms should gracefully handle other values accordingly.\nparam = QgsProcessingParameterString( \u0026#39;PRINTER_NAME\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Printer name\u0026#39;) # show only printers which are available on the current system as options # for the string input. param.setMetadata( {\u0026#39;widget_wrapper\u0026#39;: { \u0026#39;value_hints\u0026#39;: [\u0026#39;Inkjet printer\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Laser printer\u0026#39;] } }) This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: QgsExifTools class support for fetching tag values ¶ The QgsExifTools class can now retrieve individual exif tags from images using the readTag function.\nE.g.: QgsExifTools.readTag('/my/photo/0997.JPG'), 'Exif.Image.DateTime')\nKnown exif tags representing time values are automatically converted to Q{Date,Time,DateTime} objects. This makes working with those tags much easier and integrates well with other parts of the QGIS API.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nNotable Fixes ¶ Bug fixes by Even Rouault ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.16 backport commit (GitHub) Remark WFS / GML parse issue, but QGIS loads GML as file fine? #45017 Not a bug POST request to modify timestamp does not respect defined format #44990 Wontfix / not a bug Warning message 'Cannot create temporary SpatiaLite cache' when adding many WFS-layers #44971 Duplicate QGIS creates invalid filter for WFS GetFeature request #43957 PR #45043 PR #45053 WFS Layer is not rendered when requested CRS is not matching project CRS and \u0026quot;Only request features overlapping the view extent\u0026quot;

Håvard was a very active member of the QGIS community, providing valuable input to the documentation, developing numerous plugins, and taking care of the QGIS Resources Sharing Repository to name just a few of his contributions. The map on the QGIS 3.24 splash screen is an orienteering map that Håvard has created. He liked spending some time each year map-making at Tisler.\nWe would also like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and all the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible. From the QGIS community, we hope you enjoy this release!

The extent widget in QGIS now allows you to directly retrieve and match the extent of maps from bookmarks and layouts in your project.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Easier creation of custom coordinate reference systems ¶ We've added a new option when selecting a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) which allows you to just directly enter a custom CRS definition (from proj or WKT strings), instead of requiring you to specifically add these custom CRS to the projection database first.\nIt's much friendlier when you just want to define a custom projection for a single-purpose use, e.g. an overview map with a projection designed for a particular latitude and longitude location.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Marker/hash line: offsets along line by \u0026quot;percent\u0026quot; of line length (and negative offsets!) ¶ You can now specify the offset along line in percentage for both marker and hash line symbol layer types. (These offsets are treated as percentages of the overall line length).\nAdditionally, when the offset along line setting for a marker or hash line symbol layer is longer than the size of a closed ring, QGIS will now treat the offset as continuing to loop around the ring. For example, setting the offset to 150% results in the offset being treated as 50% of the length of the closed ring.\nLastly, we also made it possible to specify a negative offset along line for a closed ring. Negative offsets are calculated backwards along the ring.\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Control whether first/last vertex placements apply to every part of multi-part geometries ¶ This new symbology option for the Marker and Hash line symbol types allows you to control whether the First and Last Vertex placement options should apply to every part of a multi-part line (or polygon) individually, or only the very first and last vertex in the whole multi-part geometry.\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Marker/hash line \u0026quot;on vertices\u0026quot; placement option replaced by \u0026quot;on inner vertices\u0026quot; ¶ The new On Inner Vertices mode places the symbols on all inner vertices only (i.e. all vertices except the first or last vertex).\nPreviously, the old \u0026quot;Vertex\u0026quot; mode put symbols on the first and last vertex as well as all inner vertices, making it basically impossible to style a line with a different marker on the first or last vertex to the rest of the line's vertices. With the new On Inner Vertices option it's easy to create a style where a line has a different marker on the first or last vertex vs the rest of the vertices!\n(This change is paired nicely with the switch to using checkboxes for the placement options -- to get a marker to show on all vertices, just make sure the first, last and inner vertices options are checked).\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Placement options in marker and hash line symbol layers are now checkboxes instead of mutually exclusive buttons ¶ This improvement makes it considerably easier to create marker (or hash) lines with the markers on both the first and last vertex (amongst other useful combinations!)\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Control the color model used when interpolating gradient ramps ¶ When rendering a gradient ramp some combinations of gradient colors will cause the ramp to pass through murky grey mid-tones if the interpolation is performed using red/green/blue channels independently. An alternative approach is to instead interpolate colors via their hue/saturation/lightness or value channels. This approach can avoid these desaturated mid tones, resulting in more visually pleasing gradients.\nWe now allow the color specifcation to be set per stop in a multi-stop color gradient to give users control over which interpolation technique to use. There's also an option to control the direction which interpolation should follow for the Hue component of a HSL/HSV color spec interpolation,m which can help avoid unwanted interpolation through the entire rainbow hue spectrum in some circumstances!\nThis video shows the difference in mid-tones of a color ramp, where the RGB interpolation results in murky colors, while the HSL/HSV interpolation remains nice and vibrant.\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Resizable thumbnails in the style manager dialog ¶ We've added a new slider to control the size of thumbnails shown in the style manager dialog, because sometimes these thumbnail sizes are just too small to get a good representation of a symbol!\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: \u0026quot;Lineburst\u0026quot; symbols ¶ We've added a brand new \u0026quot;Lineburst\u0026quot; symbol layer type, which renders a gradient along the width of a line (as opposed to the Interpolated Line renderer, which renders a gradient along the length of a line). It's just like the Shapeburst fill symbol type, but for lines!\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: \u0026quot;Raster Line\u0026quot; symbols ¶ We're super-excited to bring you this brand new line symbol type, which allows you to render a raster image following a line feature's shape. This symbol type opens a whole new realm of possibilities for QGIS symbology, and is especially useful when creating maps in a hand drawn or painted style.\nOptions are available to control:\nthe picture path (including data defined path) line width opacity line join and cap styles This feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Choice of clipping behaviour for line pattern fills ¶ You can now control how lines in a line pattern fill symbol are clipped to polygon shapes. The available options include:\nClip During Render Only: lines are created covering the whole bounding box of the feature which are then clipped while drawing. The line extremities (beginning and end) will not be visible (this is same behaviour as older QGIS releases). Clip Lines Before Render: lines are clipped to the exact shape of the polygon prior to rendering. The line extremities (including cap styles, start/end marker line symbols, etc) will be visible, and may sometimes extend outside of the polygon (depending on the line symbol settings). No Clipping: no clipping at all is done - the lines will cover the whole bounding box of the feature This feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Improved rendering of line pattern fills ¶ When exporting to a vector format (e.g. PDF or SVG) or when a line subsymbol has dynamic (data defined) properties, we now automatically switch to a line-by-line based approach to render the fill. (Previously, a tiled pattern approach was always used, which often resulted in undesirable artefacts and visible seams in the pattern).\nSome of the many benefits of this change include:\nSmaller PDF/SVG output file sizes -- the line pattern fills aren't stored as raster images in the output so the overall file size will often be much smaller PDF/SVG exported files are easier to modify in external applications (such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator) for post production, as each individual line in the pattern can be modified. Better quality PDF/SVG outputs, since the fill isn't DPI dependent and looks pixel perfect regardless of how far in you zoom No visible artifacts at certain angles, distances or with certain line symbol styles And even more excitingly, it opens the door for a range of new symbol styles, for example:\nline patterns where the individual lines change color/width/dash/ etc. line patterns with marker line symbols on center point/etc geometry generator effects per line, e.g. wavy line patterns, hand drawn line styles, etc This feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Rotation angle for point pattern fills ¶ Now you can specify an optional rotation angle for point pattern fills, which causes the entire point pattern to be angled. This can be extremely useful when overlaying multiple point pattern fills!\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Randomized point offsets for point pattern fills ¶ This (optional) setting allows each point in a point pattern fill to be randomly shifted up to the specified maximum distance in the x or y direction. You can specify the maximum offset in millimeters, points, map units, or even \u0026quot;percentage\u0026quot; units (where percentage is relative to the pattern width or height).\nYou can set an optional random number seed to avoid the symbol patterns \u0026quot;jumping\u0026quot; around between map refreshes. Data defined overrides are also supported.\nThe main difference between this new setting and the existing random marker fill symbol type is that the random offset with a point pattern allows for quasi-\u0026quot;regular\u0026quot; placement of markers -- because the points in the pattern are effectively constrained to a grid, this allows creation of semi-random fills which don't have empty areas or overlapping markers. (As opposed to the random marker fill, which will always place points completely randomly... sometimes resulting in visual clusters of points or unwanted empty areas).\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Coordinate reference mode setting for line pattern and point pattern fill symbol layers ¶ Line pattern and point pattern fill symbol layers have a new coordinate reference mode setting to tweak the anchoring of the patterns. Practically speaking, this allows for patterns to nicely align across adjacent and overlapping features.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Control marker clipping for point pattern fills ¶ This new option gives you control over how markers are clipped in a point pattern fill. The available options include:\nClip to shape: markers will be clipped by the boundary of the shape, so \u0026quot;cut off\u0026quot; markers may be visible (same behaviour as previous QGIS versions) Marker centroid within shape: markers will be drawn only if their centroid falls within the shape, and markers will not be clipped to the shape boundary Marker Completely Within Shape: markers will only be drawn if they fit completely within the shape No clipping: whole marker symbols will be drawn if any part of the marker falls within the shape This feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Expression functions for creating triangular/square/curved waves ¶ We've added some new expression functions which produce \u0026quot;wavy lines\u0026quot; along geometry boundaries. Multiple wave shapes are available, including:\nWave (sine-like) Triangular Square In addition, expressions functions have also been added for creating waves in a regular fashion or with randomization.\nWhen used with geometry generators, these expressions can be used for some very advanced cartographic effects!\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nLabelling ¶ Feature: \u0026quot;Percentage\u0026quot; units for text buffer size, shadow offset and blur radius ¶ We now allow the sizes for text buffer, shadow offset and shadow blur radius to be set as a percentage of the font size. This is desirable as it allows the creation of text formats where the components nicely scale as the text size is changed, instead of having fixed buffer/shadow sizes that need to be independently adjusted when the text size changes.\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Data defined label positions by point geometries ¶ You can now set the data defined placement of labels to be bound to a point geometry field or expression. (Previous QGIS versions only allowed data defined placement to be set via two separate numeric x and y fields).\nThis change also allow you to use the Move Label tool to change the position of a label which is bound to a point geometry field, causing the new label position to be stored as a point geometry in that attribute.\nThis feature was funded by Swiss QGIS user group\nThis feature was developed by Damiano Lombardi\nFeature: Stretched text for labels and text formats ¶ This improvement allows your text to be horizontally stretched or condensed by a percentage factor. It's often handy for tweaking the widths of fonts to fit a bit of extra text into labels (when used sparingly, that is... you can certainly abuse font stretching with some horrendous results!)\nNote: This improvement requires Qt 6.3+ or KDE's 5.15 fork. (On other builds the stretch options are hidden and can't be set)\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nRendering ¶ Feature: Rendering layers as groups ¶ This is another exciting cartographic enhancement which opens up a whole new arena of symbology and map visualisation in QGIS!\nPrior to this improvement, QGIS supported grouping layers within the layer tree as a means of structuring projects, but these groups had no impact on how the component layers were rendered. In QGIS 3.24 we've introduced a new option allowing these layer groups to \u0026quot;Render as Group\u0026quot;, which causes all the component layers to be rendered as a single flattened object during map renders.\nThis option is available within the layer styling dock whenever a group layer is selected. This panel also allows you to control the appearance of the group as a whole, with options for the overall group opacity, blend mode, and layer effects!\nAdditionally, when a layer is contained in a group which has the new Render as Group option activated, new blending modes will be available which perform \u0026quot;clipping\u0026quot; style operations during the render. These allow you to achieve some very powerful results, such as clipping the render of one layer's content by the content in a second \u0026quot;mask\u0026quot; layer!\nThis feature was funded by Andrew Fletcher.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Support for \u0026quot;Line pattern\u0026quot; when converting Mapbox GL vector tile layer styles ¶ Making use of the brand new raster line symbol layer, QGIS 3.24 now properly renders Mapbox GL line pattern styling for newly-added vector tile layers.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Support background styles for Mapbox GL-styled vector tile layers ¶ We now correctly render any predefined background styling present in Mapbox GL-styled vector tile layers. This dramatically improves the appearance of vector tile layers with dark styles!\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Respect Z ordering when rendering point clouds in 2D ¶ We've added an option to render point clouds according to their Z-order in 2D map views. With the new bottom-to-top ordering option enabled, points with larger Z values will cover lower points -- resulting in the appearance of a true orthographic photo. There's also an option for reverse sorting (top-to-bottom), where the scene appears as if viewed from below.\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding: Enhancing elevation data and point clouds in QGIS\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Dock/Undock 3D views ¶ We've been aware that using dock widgets for 3D maps can be inconvenient, and in many situations these are frustrating to resize and move as they are prone to re-dock as you adjust their sizes! With QGIS 3.24 we added the ability to switch 3D maps from a dockable widget to a top-level window (and back to a dock widget), so that these map views can now be managed, resized and moved just like a standard application window.\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding: Enhancing elevation data and point clouds in QGIS\nThis feature was developed by Nedjima Belgacem (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: 3D map view manager ¶ Previously, if you closed a 3D map view and then saved your project, the 3D map view and all its settings would be lost when you reopen that project. So in QGIS 3.24 we've added a \u0026quot;3D map view manager\u0026quot; that takes care of listing, removing, renaming and duplicating 3D map views in your projects!\nWe've also added a new \u0026quot;3D Map Views\u0026quot; menu, which contains all your created 3D map views for easy access!\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding: Enhancing elevation data and point clouds in QGIS\nThis feature was developed by Nedjima Belgacem (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Improved camera navigation ¶ The default navigation mode in earlier versions of QGIS would sometimes behave strangely when moving around, rotating or zooming in/out. A lot of effort went into improvements of the camera control, so since QGIS 3.24 the camera navigation's behavior should feel more natural and similar to other 3D mapping software.\nFor more details, see Fixing terrain and camera issues in 3D\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.org grant (2021)\nThis feature was developed by Nedjima Belgacem (Lutra Consulting)\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Full text rendering capabilities for layout text labels ¶ In older QGIS releases you had to revert to hacky tricks like using HTML and CSS to add effects like drop shadows to text in your map layouts. Hack no more! In 3.24 we now allow you to use the familiar properties from the labeling text options for text on layouts too! This means you can now add shadows, text buffers, backgrounds, letter and word spacing, etc. all on the text items in your layouts.\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nExpressions ¶ Feature: geometry_type function ¶ The new geometry_type function returns the high-level type of a geometry (i.e. 'Point', 'Line' or 'Polygon').\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Overlay intersects sort by intersection size ¶ We have added further enhancements to the overlay_intersects function. The change adds two new optional arguments to the existing function:\nreturn_details: only valid when used with an expression, set this to true to return a list of maps containing (key names in quotes) the feature 'id', the expression 'result' and the 'overlap' value, the 'radius' of the maximum inscribed circle is also returned when the target layer is a polygon. sort_by_intersection_size: only valid when used with an expression, set this to true to return the results ordered by the overlap value in descending order. This feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn, Amt für Geoinformation\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Show all layer field names when building expressions ¶ As a handy time-saver, we now make a list of all field names from all layers in your project available directly in the expression builder. If you double-click any of these field names, they'll be added to your expression as string values ('field_name').\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: represent_attributes function ¶ This new function returns a map with all attribute (field) names as the keys and the configured representation values as values. The representation value for the attributes depends on the configured widget type for each attribute.\nThe function can be used with zero, one, or more arguments:\nIf called with no parameters, the function will return the representation of the attributes of the current feature in the current layer. If called with a 'feature' parameter only, the function will return the representation of the attributes of the specified feature from the current layer. If called with a 'layer' and a 'feature' parameter, the function will return the representation of the attributes of the specified feature from the specified layer. This feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Optional minimum overlap area and circle radius for overlay_intersection ¶ We have added two optional arguments to the overlay_intersection() expression function:\nmin_overlap: for polygons an optional minimum area in current feature squared units for the intersection (if the intersection results in multiple polygons the intersection will be returned if at least one of the polygons has an area greater or equal to the value), for lines an optional minimum length in current feature units (if the intersection results in multiple lines the intersection will be returned if at least one of the lines has a length greater or equal to the value) min_inscribed_circle_radius: for polygons only an optional minimum radius in current feature units for the maximum inscribed circle of the intersection (if the intersection results in multiple polygons the intersection will be returned if at least one of the polygons has a radius for the maximum inscribed circle greater or equal to the value). Read more on the underlying GEOS predicate, as described in PostGIS ST_MaximumInscribedCircle function. This feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: map_prefix_keys function ¶ In QGIS 3.24 we've added a new map_prefix_keys function that takes a map and a prefix, the function returns a map with all keys prefixed by the prefix.\nExample: map_prefix_keys(map('1','one','2','two'), 'prefix-')\nreturns: { 'prefix-1': 'one', 'prefix-2': 'two' }\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: densify_by_count and densify_by_distance functions ¶ This functionality, which was previously only available through the Processing toolbox, is now available for use in expressions!\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Rotate parts of multi-part geometries independently with \u0026quot;rotate\u0026quot; expression function ¶ The new \u0026quot;per_part\u0026quot; option for the \u0026quot;rotate\u0026quot; expression function allows you to rotate each part of a multi-part geometry around the center of each part (instead of the center of the geometry as a whole). This enhancement is designed to help out symbology when the rotate function is used as a cartographic tool as part of a geometry generator symbol layer.\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: apply_dash_pattern function ¶ This exciting new expression function applies a dash pattern to a geometry, returning a MultiLineString geometry which is the input geometry stroked along each line (or ring) using a dashed line pattern.\nRules can be set to control how the dash pattern is adjusted at line endings. If you specify a start rule or end rule, then the \u0026quot;adjustment\u0026quot; option defines whether both dash and gaps, or only dash or gap sizes are adjusted to apply these rules.\nYou can also set an optional pattern offset to specify how far along the pattern the result should start at.\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: scale function ¶ This new expression function allows you to scale (resize) a geometry. Just like the 'rotate' function, the function accepts an optional point position to apply the scaling from. If no anchor point is not specified then scaling is done from the center of the geometry's bounding box.\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Filter by multiple attributes for get_feature function ¶ We extended the get_feature function to allow multi-attribute filtering, by adding an option to pass an array of filter values to the input.\nThis feature was developed by Alex\nData Management ¶ Feature: Multiedit support for relation editor ¶ We've added a new multi edit mode for the relation editor, which allows the rapid addition of child features to multiple parent features. This improves efficiency for data management operations, such as the ability to select multiple trees and adding a maintenance item to all of them in one click.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Model Baker\nThis feature was developed by Damiano Lombardi, OPENGIS.ch\nMetadata and Metasearch ¶ Feature: Support for OGC API - Records in MetaSearch ¶ We updated the MetaSearch tool to provide support for the OGC API - Records (OARec) standard. As part of the OGC API evolution, OGC API - Records is the successor to OGC:CSW (like OGC API - Features is to WFS, etc.).\nThe OGC API - Records standard is currently in development and the current timeline for a public RFC by OGC is Q1 2022. This we ask you to take note of the draft status of the specification so you are aware that the specification may change a bit more over the next few months. We still need to flesh out how actionable links are handled over the next few months (which should be a significant improvement compared to the CSW publish/find/bind workflow).\nAdding this feature to QGIS is a huge win for easier search and will help both users and providers for the long term.\nThis feature was developed by Tom Kralidis\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Form submit actions with HTTP POST ¶ In QGIS 3.24 we added two new HTTP POST actions, similar to the existing Open action which uses an HTTP GET request.\nThe two actions differ in the way the form data are encoded:\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded multipart/form-data In both cases, data are passed to the action in a URL encoded URL.\nA new function url_encode(\u0026lt;map\u0026gt;) is provided to convert a dictionary (a map) to the encoded format.\nThe response from the submitted URL is opened by delegating to the operating system QDesktopServices::openUrl() after the payload has been stored in a temporary file.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: New button to open attribute table on filtered features ¶ We've added a new button to the attribute form (when in search mode) which enables you to open an attribute table filtered to only show the matching features.\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: Add roundness method to curve polygon ¶ We added a \u0026quot;roundness\u0026quot; method to QgsCurvePolygon, allowing the calculation of the \u0026quot;roundness\u0026quot; of an area feature based on the formula Roundness = (4 * pi * Area) / Perimeter^2.\nThis includes the addition of a new expression and a processing tool for calculating roundness. The processing tool creates a new layer with the roundness of each feature in a new field.\nThis feature was developed by Antoine Facchini\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Extract labels algorithm ¶ For 3.24 we added a new tool to QGIS' processing toolbox: \u0026quot;Extract labels\u0026quot;. As its name hints at, this algorithm extracts label information from a rendered map at a specific extent and scale.\nExtracted label information include its position (as point geometries), the associated layer name and feature ID, as well as label appearance properties such as rotation, text, alignment, font family, size, weight, etc.\nThe algorithm also generates a default symbol-less \u0026amp; labelled style for the output layer which allows for those saved layers to be drag and dropped into projects and have the label drawn exactly as they were exported.\nIf a map theme is specified when extracting labels, the exported labels will match the visibility and symbology of that theme. If left blank, the project's current visible layers will be used.\nThis feature was funded by TEKSI\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Optional output extent parameter for the GDAL Raster Calculator algorithm ¶ When running against GDAL 3.3 or newer, QGIS processing toolbox's GDAL Raster Calculator algorithm now allows you to specify an optional \u0026quot;output extent\u0026quot; parameter. This can be quite useful when working with large datasets, often avoiding the need to create an intermediary clipped raster prior to running the calculator algorithm.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Optional extent parameter for the GDAL clip raster by mask algorithm ¶ We added an optional extent parameter to the GDAL \u0026quot;clip raster by mask\u0026quot; algorithm, which can come in handy when working with large raster datasets.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Processing history rework ¶ QGIS 3.24 includes a partial implementation of the framework described in QEP 130, and ports the Processing history log over to this framework.\nThis is a much more flexible approach to storing Processing history, as it allows us to store unlimited additional information about the executed tool (including all the input parameters, output results, and the full text log too!). The history log is now stored in a sqlite database instead of the text file previously used, which allows for more efficient storage/retrieval/filtering.\nThe new framework potentially extends to more than just Processing - it could also be used to store the history of other user operations, such as project edits, layout exports etc!\nWe'll be using this framework in future to further extend the Processing history dialog. For 3.24, we're using it to expose a number of helpful additions to the history dialog:\nRight clicking an entry in the log has a new option to copy the execution parameters as a \u0026quot;qgis_process\u0026quot; command line equivalent, giving you a super-easy way to generate qgis_process commands for execution in a CLI. Right clicking an entry also shows a new \u0026quot;Copy as JSON\u0026quot; option, which copies a JSON string of the input parameters and algorithm settings This feature was funded by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest, Flemish Govt\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Advanced actions in Processing dialogs ¶ We have added new actions on the processing dialog including copy as qgis_process command, and copy/paste as JSON. Together these actions:\nAllows for easy copying of the equivalent PyQGIS command to run the tool using the parameters defined in the dialog Allow for easy generation of qgis_process commands via the QGIS GUI, including any tricky parameter values like GeoPackage outputs with specific layers Provide a way for you to copy the settings defined in the dialog in a text format, so that you can store these easily and then restore them later by pasting the values. Provides an easy way for you to copy the settings into the JSON format consumed by qgis_process, so that it is easy to see the expected format even for complex parameters (like TIN interpolation parameters). This feature was funded by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest, Flemish Govt\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Single file exports from Atlas to PDF algorithm ¶ You can now export an atlas layout to a single (collated) PDF file using the \u0026quot;Export atlas layout as PDF\u0026quot; processing algorithm.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Project Models are shown in the Project menu ¶ We added a new submenu to the \u0026quot;Project\u0026quot; menu, which will list any Processing models stored within the current project. This gives you a quick way to launch these project-specific models, in either a single or batch mode!\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Add point cloud destination parameter and output to Processing ¶ We have extended and improved point cloud support in Processing, namely by:\nFixing the filtering of point cloud layers in QgsProcessingMapLayerComboBox-based widget used for parameters Adding a destination point cloud parameter type and point cloud output types with corresponding widgets. (Currently these are useful for 3rd party providers and plugins which create point cloud outputs.) Exposing the newly added point cloud output and destination parameters to the algfactory wrapper This feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Array field support ¶ In QGIS 3.24, we've made array field types first-class citizen in the Processing toolbox! The following algorithms have all been updated to support array fields:\nRefactor algorithm; Aggregate algorithm; Add field to attributes table algorithm; Field calculator algorithm; and Advanced (i.e. python) field calculator algorithm This feature was funded by SwissTierras Colombia\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: qgis_process --no-python argument ¶ This new, optional command line parameter for the qgis_process command-line tool allows you to skip launching Processing with Python support when it is not required. This can result in a significant improvement in qgis_process startup times!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Suppress \u0026quot;bad layers\u0026quot; handler on startup ¶ We've added support for a new command line flag for the qgis executable, which allows you to disable the default dialog which shows when opening a project with missing/broken layers:\n[--skipbadlayers] don't prompt for missing layers Example invocation: ./qgis --skipbadlayers or ./qgis -B\nThe use case for this is that sometimes users have automation or other post-startup processes happen and do not want to have the startup process interrupted if there are bad layers present in the project. After startup, QGIS will ignore any missing layers, but they will still be marked as broken in the layers list.\nThis feature was suggested by Giuseppe Baiamonte during, and live coded on, the QGIS Open Day, 17 Dec 2021.\nThis feature was developed by Tim Sutton\nFeature: Parameter values for qgis_process can be specified as a JSON object via stdin ¶ We now provide a mechanism to support complex input parameters for algorithms when running the qgis_process command line tool.\nTo indicate that parameters will be specified via stdin then the qgis_process command must follow the format\nqgis_process run algid - (with a trailing - in place of the usual arguments list).\nThe JSON object must contain an \u0026quot;inputs\u0026quot; key, which is a map of the input parameter values.\necho \u0026#34;{\u0026#34;inputs\u0026#34;: {\\\u0026#34;INPUT\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;my_shape.shp\\\u0026#34;, DISTANCE: 5}}\u0026#34; | qgis_process run native:buffer - Additionally, extra settings like the distance units, area units, ellipsoid and project path can be included in this JSON object:\n{ \u0026#39;ellipsoid\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;EPSG:7019\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;distance_units\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;feet\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;area_units\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;ha\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;project_path\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c:/temp/my_project.qgs\u0026#39; \u0026#39;inputs\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;DISTANCE\u0026#39;: 5, ..... } } (Specifying input parameters via stdin implies automatically the --json output format for results.)\nOne big motivation behind this enhancement is to provide a way for the qgis_process R libraries to support parameter types such as aggregates!\nThis feature was funded by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest, Flemish Govt\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Run Python script algorithms directly via qgis_process ¶ The qgis_process command-line tool now supports running a Python script algorithm directly by specifying the path to the .py file, in place of an algorithm ID or model file path!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Friendlier errors from XYZ raster tiles, WMS and vector tiles ¶ Server errors which occur during XYZ, vector tile or WMS network requests are now shown directly in the QGIS window via the message bar. We've made these error messages much more descriptive and helpful, by including the original response error text wherever possible!\nThis feature was funded by MapTiler\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Add out-of-the-box connection to Mapzen Global Terrain tiles ¶ QGIS now sports built-in support for the Terrarium DEM format for WMS/XYZ layers. In addition, we now have out-of-the-box ability to add Mapzen Global Terrain Tiles hosted on AWS. You can find the new MapZen option in the XYZ section of the browser panel. Users now have an immediately accessible global DEM source for their projects!! See also https://registry.opendata.aws/terrain-tiles/\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: HMAC SHA256 auth method for MapTiler ¶ We've added a new authentication method specific for MapTiler which allows you to use a token encrypted with HMAC-SHA256.\nThis feature was funded by MapTiler\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Template parameter {usage} for XYZ raster and vector tiles ¶ For XYZ tile-based raster layers and for vector tile layers, we now allow the possibility to insert {usage} template parameters (in addition to {x}, {y}, {z}). If present, this parameter will be replaced by the context in which the request is being made.\nThe possible context values are:\nview - when the request comes from 2D or 3D map canvas export - when the request comes from exporting a layer or exporting a print layout for high-quality output (map previews in print layout designer are classed as \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo;) unknown - when coming from some other context, but the source is unknown This functionality is useful for MapTiler clients, where they need to recognize the context in which tiles are used in order to bill users accordingly.\nThis feature was funded by MapTiler\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Convert WMTS/XYZ raster tiles to terrain (DEM) ¶ In QGIS 3.24 we've introduced the possibility to convert WMTS/XYZ raster datasets to a raster layer of single band float type following a predefined encoding scheme.\nYou can activate this option and choose an encoding scheme (for now, \u0026quot;MapTiler Terrain RGB\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Terrarium Terrain RGB\u0026quot; are available) in the source settings of the XYZ connection or in the Data Source Manager when adding a WMST layer.\nThe selected converter will translate the RGB source values to float values for each pixel. After loading, the layer will be presented as a single band floating point raster layer, ready for styling using a pseudocolor or hill shade renderer!\nThis feature was funded by MapTiler\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Array field types for scratch layers ¶ You can now add array field types directly to newly created scratch layers. (While array field types have previously been supported by scratch layers, there was no way for users to add them when creating a new scratch layer.)\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: JSON field types for new GeoPackage layers ¶ We've added support for creating JSON fields directly to newly created GeoPackage layers. (While JSON field types have previously been supported by GeoPackage layers, there was no way for users to add them when creating a new layer.)\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Delimited text type overrides and other improvements ¶ We've given some love to the delimited text data provider in 3.24, with several enhancements which include:\nBoolean type support and automatic detection\nBoolean data types are now first-class citizens, which are automatically recognized when all records in a column contain one of the following values (case insensitive):\nt/f true/false yes/no 0/1 Boolean fields are also detected from a CSVT file, a GDAL/GeoCSV format e.g.\nInteger(Boolean)\nYou can also add custom string representations for TRUE/FALSE (for example a localized \u0026quot;yes\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;no\u0026quot; value).\nColumn type override\nColumn types are automatically determined (by an initial limited scan of the file for immediate feedback followed by a full scan of the file which happens in a separate thread to not block the GUI and is user-interruptible), the types are exposed to the GUI as combo boxes and the user can override the automatically determined types.\nEnhanced CSVT support.\nCoordX, CoordY, Point(X/Y), WKT are now recognized as specified in https://giswiki.hsr.ch/GeoCSV\nThis feature was funded by Stadt Freiburg im Breisgau\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: New authentication method for HTTP header based authentication ¶ A new authentication method is available for network requests which that supports user defined HTTP header authentication. Multiple custom headers can be included in these requests.\nThis is useful in various scenarios, such as when a WMS requires an API key that is to be used in a HTTP header with the header key being X-API-KEY, which can now be included in requests from QGIS to authenticate against the WMS endpoint.\nThis feature was developed by Tom C\nFeature: Expose secondary PostGIS geometry columns as referenced geometries ¶ As discussed in this issue, we have added support for exposing additional geometry columns from the Postgres provider as QgsReferencedGeometry. This allows more efficient interaction with additional geometry columns through the API. For example, in label placement, the additional geometry column can be used instead of the feature geometry. The fields will be represented as WKT [CRS User-Friendly Identifier] in the attribute table.\nThis can be used in expressions and in the label placement properties tab where you can link the label placement to the second geometry column using the Point property. In the case where you using it for labelling, the second geometry column will be updated automatically if you use the move tool and the columnt type is Geometry. If the column type is text, you could also use that as a second geometry by doing e.g.\ngeom_from_wkt(\u0026quot;my wkt string field\u0026quot;) In this case however, the column will be read only.\nSo e.g. now in expressions if you have secondary geometry column you can do:\nbuffer(\u0026quot;my_second_geom_column\u0026quot;, 10) and it will work.\n⚠️ Warning ¶ This changes the behavior of existing projects. This feature was funded by OPENGIS.ch\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn, OPENGIS.ch\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Allow better control of the response flow chain from server filters ¶ New filters allow control of the call chain by implementing new filter callbacks that allow returning a control value for stopping propagation. This allows for the better control of streamed data and response flow.\nDeprecate bool QgsFilter::onRequestReady(), bool QgsFilter::onSendResponse(), bool QgsFilter::onResponseComplete() Add new methods bool QgsFilter::onRequestReady(), bool QgsFilter::onSendResponse(), bool QgsFilter::onResponseComplete() which return boolean values for controlling data flow Handle flow control in QgsFilterResponseDecorator::flush() This feature was developed by David Marteau\nNotable Fixes ¶ Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.22 backport commit (GitHub) Wrong raster projection on HIDPI screens #46882 PR #46931 TODO Data Source Manager title not translatable #46929 PR #46932 TODO QGIS 3.22 - Identical map names in print composer #46927 Works for me Bold and italic attributes of labels that reinitialize #46896 Works for me NameError: name 'QGISAPP' is not defined when using stop_app() #46883 Works for me on Linux/master, might be windows only Virtual layer not loaded correctly after re-opening a project #46834 PR #46938 TODO QGIS crashes while calling readLayerXml() #46741 Works for me Crash when changing orientation of page in layout #46575 PR #46972 TODO \u0026quot;sort\u0026quot; funcionality of attributes table sort numeric fields as text #34935 PR #47035 TODO OAPIF: api-key not included when requesting /collections endpoint #46535 PR #47145 TODO XML notation if missing from tooltips in vector file writer dialog #46508 PR #47148 TODO Ignore out of range option in interpolated symbol renderer creates artifacts if start value is out of range #46362 PR #47174 TODO start width \u0026gt; end width is ignored when using the \u0026quot;exact\u0026quot; color interpolation method #46371 PR #47195 TODO QGIS Layouts: using \u0026quot;Data defined override\u0026quot; for HTML Source URL not working #34395 works for me (closed - not a bug) (Un)force hide form in relation widget #47226 PR #47245 TODO Oauth2 authentication protocol does not honors the defined port number in redirect URL in QGIS 3.22.1 #46354 works for me (left open) HTML/String-ish QByteArray as result of expression function breaks expression preview display #46174 PR #47229 TODO Raster layer exported to GeoPackage with the character 'ß' in the name is not immediately loaded in the project #45965 works for me (closed) Layout Attribute Table sorting does not work in Print Layouts when column name has spaces #43744 PR #47249 TODO Incorrect scale range legend after applying logarithmic graduated symbology to a vector layer #45454 PR #47259 Risky? fix server crash unreported PR #47271 TODO Load QGIS project from command line from a PostgreSQL project #47270 PR #47272 TODO Aggregate function with filter doesn't work in layout manager #45552 Works for me (closed) Value map widget: \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;description\u0026quot; inconsistency when table added to print layouts #41798 PR #47300 TODO Missing entries in attributetable in layout with atlas at page break #44086 PR #47303 TODO Server OAPIF: bbox filter isn't working if data source CRS is not EPSG:4326/WGS84 #47302 PR #47318 TODO Drag \u0026amp; Drop designer control visibility by expression with field IS NOT NULL doesn't work if the field is configured with html #47363 PR #47432 Risky?

This includes numerous improvements to 3D capabilities, improved tooling for point clouds, and the introduction of a new profile plotting framework for the creation of cross-sections and elevation profiles. Best of all, the new plotting framework uses the native QGIS rendering capabilities and comes with all the styling, symbology, and data driven properties we all know and love baked right in!\nFor a whirlwind tour of all the new functionalities introduced, you can view the highlight reel video on YouTube at https://youtu.be/pZmrw_zR7sA\nThe QGIS Community has also been active in various crowd-funding campaigns, Open Day events, and the growth of the STAC Ecosystem has led to inter-agency collaboration initiatives which include outcomes such as the STAC Browser QGIS Plugin, which make it nearly trivial to produce Raster Mosaics from Earth Observation data using Open Source and Open Data. There is also a new online analytics dashboard which collects information from the QGIS Feed in an attempt to show how and where QGIS is being used, providing valuable insight to developers and the QGIS community.\nWe would also like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible. From the QGIS community, we hope you enjoy this release!

As no maintainers have come forward to support the maintenance of this data provider, it has been removed and will no longer be available for use in QGIS.\nMap Tools ¶ Feature: Selecting all features by attribute value from Identify Results panel ¶ The identify results tools now provides an option available from the context menu of an attribute field value which allows for the quick selection of all features in that layer with matching values to be selected.\nThis feature was funded by Camptocamp\nThis feature was developed by Ismail Sunni\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Coordinate ordering according to CRS ¶ QGIS will now use the correct coordinate ordering for the project CRS when displaying coordinates in status bar (and identify results). A setting has been added in the project properties to allow users to override this with a specific coordinate ordering if desired (x/y or y/x).\nSpecifically, this means that projects in geographic CRS like EPSG:4326 will now show coordinates in latitude/longitude order instead of longitude/latitude (unless the specific CRS has different native ordering).\nThis feature was funded by SevenCs GmbH\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Select features from expression based symbols ¶ A \u0026quot;Select Features\u0026quot; action has been added to the right click context menu on legend class symbols. This allows you to rapidly select all features within a layer that match the associated symbol class in categorized, graduated, and rule based renderers.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Copy preview expression value to clipboard ¶ A new button has been added to the expression builder interface which allows the copying of the value in the expression preview field to the clipboard.\nThis feature was funded by Camptocamp\nThis feature was developed by Ismail Sunni\nFeature: Option to synchronize statistics panel with layer selection ¶ A \u0026quot;Keep synchronized with TOC\u0026quot; checkbox has been added to the statistics panel, which allows the statistics panel to automatically synchronize with the table of contents layer list, ensuring that the active layer is selected for the computed statistics displayed in the statistics panel.\nThe most recently defined expression used for defining the statistics calculation on a layer will be retained for each layer independently.\nThis feature was developed by Jacky Volpes\nFeature: Implement scroll wheel action for color and symbol buttons ¶ Triggering a mouse wheel action while hovering a symbol layers will now automatically adjust one of the style attributes, making it more efficient to adjust common symbology rules. This feature affects different symbol styles in various ways, based on which UI control is selected.\nFor marker symbols, the marker size increases / decreases For line symbols, the line width increases / decreases In addition, when triggering a mouse wheel action while hovering a color symbol, the color opacity will increase / decrease.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nAccessibility ¶ Feature: Horizontal table scroll with shift+wheel ¶ Attribute tables can now be scrolled horizontally using the key combination of Shift+ Mouse wheel, switching from the default vertical scroll operation.\nThis matches the behavior exposed by LibreOffice, and provides a convenient way to quickly horizontally scroll tables when a mouse doesn't have a dedicated horizontal scroll wheel.\nThis feature was funded by the City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nSymbology ¶ Feature: New \u0026quot;Animated Marker\u0026quot; symbol type ¶ A new marker symbol type allows points to be rendered using an animated marker, sourced from an animated gif, webp or mng animation. Options are present for marker file, size, angle and frame rate.\nThere are two ways in which animated symbols are handled.\nIf the map is NOT considered an animation (i.e. a regular QGIS project), then the frame to render will be based on the current timestamp alone. If the map itself is considered an animation, then the frame rendered for the animated marker is based on the map animation frame and frame rate. This is the case when the temporal controller is set to the Animation mode. In this case, the animated markers will follow the temporal controller animation, e.g. pausing when the animation is paused, advancing frames with the animation, etc. This mode also applies when exporting an animation from the temporal controller and is used when a plugin specifically sets the frame rate and current frame properties. This feature was funded by North Road Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Allow any symbol to be an animated symbol ¶ Users can now indicate that a symbol should be treated as an animated symbol, through the new \u0026quot;Animation Settings\u0026quot; option in the symbol widget's Advanced menu.\nThis settings panel allows users to enable animation for the symbol and set a specific frame rate at which the symbol should be redrawn. When enabled, the @symbol_frame variable can be used in any symbol data defined property in order to animate that property.\nFor instance, setting the symbol's rotation to the following data defined expression will cause the symbol to rotate over time, with rotation speed dictated by the symbol's refresh rate.\n@symbol_frame % 360 This feature was funded by North Road Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Add a new classification method for \u0026quot;Fixed interval\u0026quot; ¶ Allows users to create graduated breaks using a specific interval width for classes (instead of the total number of classes).\nThis feature was funded by SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Custom dash pattern panel shows total pattern length ¶ The custom dash pattern panel now displays the total dash pattern length, enhancing the ability for users to match the overall pattern length with sizes from other parts of a symbol.\nThis feature was funded by North Road Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Select style categories when storing styles in database ¶ QGIS supports the storing of layer styles in the source database, or in the local style database. QGIS then provides the ability to use those styles as the default style for a layer, or provide access to the style via the style manager.\nIn prior releases of QGIS, this process stored all available style categories in the database, however new functionality allows users to select which specific style categories should be stored, providing a similar level of flexibility for storing styles in database sources as was previously available only for the QML and SLD style formats.\nThis feature was developed by Jacky Volpes\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Allow data-defined control over line anchor type ¶ Allows data-defined control over whether the 'hint' or 'strict' anchoring type is used.\nThis feature was funded by City of Freiburg im Breisgau\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Control label anchor placement relative to text position ¶ A control is now provided for defining what part of the text (start, middle, or end) of line labels correspond to the anchor position defined in label placement. This allows for more precise placement of labels according to specific requirements, such as lining up the end of a labels text with a specific point on a line feature.\nIn prior releases of QGIS, labels would always be centered over the anchor position of lines, unless it was a curved label, which used the start of the label for determining the anchor orientation.\nA new option for \u0026quot;Follow placement\u0026quot; has also been added, which means that the text anchor will depend on the placement along line setting. This control attempts to determine the appropriate alignment option automatically according to the label placement on the feature and exhibits the following behaviors:\nFor labels anchored near the start of the line (0-25%), the anchor placement will be the start of the label text For labels anchored near the end of the line (75-100%), the anchor placement will be the end of the label text For anchor placements between 25 and 75%, the anchor placement will be the center of the label text This feature was funded by City of Freiburg im Breisgau\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Interactively move curved line labels along their line features ¶ Placement of curved label text can now be manipulated by using the interactive \u0026quot;Move Labels\u0026quot; tool.\nThis feature was funded by City of Freiburg im Breisgau\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nRendering ¶ Feature: WMS provider resampling ¶ Following the ability of QGIS 3.24 to convert WMS raster tiles to elevation data, QGIS has further been enhanced to include various resampling methods to reduce rendering artifacts in WMS DEM sources, such as pixelation encountered with hillshade rendering.\nThis feature was funded by Maptiler\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Vincent Cloarec)\nFeature: Selective masking vectorization ¶ QGIS introduced a selective masking feature in version 3.12, however the implementation relied on the rasterization of the map products and made it unsuitable for some cartographic work.\nThis long awaited feature implements selective masking in a way that vectorizes appropriate masked or clipped features wherever possible, allowing high quality vector outputs for SVG and PDF maps which use the masking features of QGIS.\nThis is implemented in line with QEP 186.\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Transparency support for 3D Phong material ¶ Provides support for rendering semi transparent objects in 3D. An opacity slider is provided for the phong material widget, which defaults to 100% (fully opaque).\nThis feature was funded by Swedish QGIS user group.\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Nedjima Belgacem)\nFeature: 3D Maps inherit terrain settings from project ¶ When a new 3D map is created in the project, the map will default to using the same terrain settings as are defined for the project. This makes it easier to create and destroy 3D maps, without having to re-setup their terrain settings each time.\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Sync 2D and 3D navigation ¶ A new \u0026quot;Navigation sync\u0026quot; setting for 3D map frames provides the ability to automatically synchronize the 2D main map canvas extent and the 3D viewport based on various navigation options.\nOption 1: Whenever the camera is moved in the 3D view, the main map (2D) canvas extent will be set to the viewed area Option 2: Every change in position on the main map canvas (2D) will result in the 3D camera orientation being shifted to view approximately the same extent from the top (Nadir view position) Option 3: A trapezoid area representing the field of view from the 3D map frame will be drawn on the main map (2D) canvas Actions are also available for quickly turning these options on and off.\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Nedjima Belgacem)\nFeature: 3D axis in 3D map viewer ¶ A 3D axis annotation has been added to the 3D map viewer allowing users to better orient their view with their data.\nThis various additional includes controls and options for:\nDisplaying axis for X/Y/Z or using North/East/South/West based on the frame coordinate reference system (CRS) Displaying a face-labeled cube instead of typical axis arrows This feature was developed by benoitdm-oslandia\nPoint Clouds ¶ Feature: Point cloud triangulation in 3D views ¶ QGIS can now render point cloud layers in the 3D view as a solid surface, which is obtained by 2.5D triangulation.\nTriangulation is configured using a checkbox in the 3D styling options, and configuration options allow exclusion of triangles which surpass user defined thresholds for width or height.\nThis triangulation is available for all the 3D point cloud renderer styles, including unique color, ramp color, classification, and RGB.\nThis feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec\nFeature: Cloud Optimized Point Clouds (COPC) support ¶ QGIS now provides support for reading Cloud Optimized Point Clouds from local and remote data sources.\nFor more information on the COPC format, visit https://copc.io/.\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Nedjima Belgacem)\nFeature: Point cloud filtering ¶ Filtering support has been added for point cloud layers, including a graphical query tool. Using filter expressions, point cloud points on both 2d and 3d canvases may be conditionally displayed based on xyz and/or LAS attributes.\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Stefanos Natsis)\nFeature: Point cloud style synchronization ¶ A new \u0026quot;Follow 2d renderer\u0026quot; style for 3D point cloud symbology allows for a point cloud layer's 3D symbol to be kept in sync with its 2D counterpart. Any changes to the 2D symbology will be automatically applied to the 3D symbology.\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Stefanos Natsis)\nFeature: Improvements to the classified renderer ¶ Classified renderer for point clouds has been improved to:\nShow only classes that are in the dataset (instead of hard-coded list) \u0026amp; show also non-standard classes Show percentage of points for each class Work also for other attributes (return number, number of returns, point source and few other classes) This feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting (Stefanos Natsis)\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Apply font settings from layer conditional styling to layout attribute tables ¶ Previously, only the font color and background color settings from the conditional styling rules were applied to attribute tables in layouts. Additional styling settings such as font family, bold, italic, strikeout, and underline are now applied from conditional rules.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Scalebar Data Defined Overrides ¶ Adds data defined overrides to the Scalebar layout item. This feature is useful when generating an atlas with the atlas feature containing the scale as a field. The map can be driven by this value, but the scalebar cannot. This implements #48084, which allows the scalebar properties to be data driven by the atlas feature.\nThis feature was developed by Ethan Snyder\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Between/Not between operators ¶ QGIS now includes support for SQL-like BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN operators in expression clauses.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Static parent variable in aggregate expression functions ¶ In prior releases of QGIS, aggregate expressions did not pass the parent object parameters as static variables, preventing them from being executed by the data provider (e.g. PostgreSQL). This change will result in significant performance increases for a number of aggregate expressions. For example, in the aggregate expression:\nIF(aggregate(layer:='parks',aggregate:='count', expression:= 't_id', filter:=intersects( $geometry, geometry(@parent))) \u0026lt; 1, 'FALSE', 'TRUE')\nThe execution of the intersects( $geometry, geometry(@parent)) filter will be performed on the data provider directly.\nThis feature was funded by Amt für Geoinformation Kanton Schaffhausen\nThis feature was developed by David Signer\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Add a checkbox to disable vertex tool dock auto-opening behavior ¶ The vertex tool dock now has a new checkbox for \u0026quot;Auto-open table\u0026quot;, which is checked by default and retains the existing behavior.\nIf a user opts to uncheck this, then the vertex editor dock auto open/close behavior will be disabled, leaving the dock as regular QGIS dock which behaves the same as any other dock.\nThis is desirable in situations when:\nThe user is editing in a full screen session with docks hidden, and doesn't want the vertex editor dock to keep opening itself The user has a heavily customized setup of stacked/tabbed/rearranged docks, and doesn't want the vertex editor dock to keep appearing and disappearing and causing other docks to be rearranged If a user has opted out of the auto-open table behavior, then the dock can be closed and won't show immediately when switching to the vertex tool. The dock can then be re-opened either through the standard Views - Panels menu (or by right clicking a toolbar), OR through a new \u0026quot;Show Vertex Editor\u0026quot; action which has been added to the dropdown menu for the vertex editor toolbar button.\nThis feature was funded by SevenCs GmbH\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Integrate shape map tools into feature digitizing ¶ The Shape Tools have been extended and integrated with the features from digitizing tools, allowing the use of map tools to use shapes for digitizing operations.\nThis includes digitizing support for items such as:\nStraightSegments CircularStrings Streaming Shapes This results in the ability to use the add part, add ring, or any other digitizing operations with the shape tools for hybrid digitizing operations, for example using the circular string or rectangle shape tools to create rings in existing area features.\nThis required significant refactoring and the porting of code from QgsMapToolDigitizeFeature to QgsMapToolCapture.\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: New constraints for advanced digitizing panel ¶ The advanced digitizing panel now includes two additional soft constraints (snapping guides) for allowing users to capture positions relative to existing features. These constraints are optionally enabled and include:\nLine extension: QGIS will provide a constraint that traces the extension of a line, based on the segment orientation defined by the selected vertex Xy vertex: QGIS will provide a constraint that runs perpendicular to an existing vertex in vertical or horizontal orientation. This feature was funded by Métropole Européenne de Lille @Jean-Roc\nThis feature was developed by Antoine Facchini\nData Management ¶ Feature: Add a \u0026quot;filter rules\u0026quot; search box to vector tile renderer and labeling widgets ¶ Users may now filter the visible rules by a portion of their label, layer or filter strings. This can greatly help with finding rules in complex vector tile styles.\nThis feature was funded by North Road Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: User defined field names in export ¶ When exporting layers, users may now override the field names in the resulting layers.\nThe export dialog fields interface includes the following changes:\nA new \u0026quot;Export names\u0026quot; column has been introduced to the fields table A convenience checkbox is provided to automatically generate aliases, or revert to original field names When field names are modified by the user, the checkbox will display a \u0026quot;PartiallyChecked\u0026quot; state indicator This feature was funded by the Swiss QGIS User Group\nThis feature was developed by Damiano Lombardi\nFeature: Georeferencing vector layers in georeferencer ¶ QGIS now supports georeferencing vector layers in the georeferencer tool. This allows vector layers without spatial referencing to be interactively georeferenced, or layers with referencing to be re-referenced, in a similar manner to raster data. Georeferencing occurs in a task, so QGIS should remain responsive, even with large datasets.\nBased on #41386\nThis feature was funded by the Danish QGIS Usergroup\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Add field domain management capabilities to browser ¶ A new API has been added to manage field domains through database connections, and QGIS now exposes this functionality through the browser panel.\nThis functionality is currently exposed only for GeoPackages, but support for other providers could potentially be exposed in future.\nIncluded in this functionality is the ability to create new field domains, as well as set the field domain for GeoPackage table fields.\nThis feature was funded by Provincie Gelderland\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Buffered Transactional Editing ¶ With this edit mode, all editable layers are toggled synchronously and all edits are saved in a local edit buffer. Saving changes is executed within a single transaction on all layers (per provider).\nThis new edit mode attempts to provide a hybrid alternative for managing the data editing approaches used in the current editing modes, local edit buffers and transactional editing, and is implemented in line with QEP 203\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Glarus\nThis feature was developed by Damiano Lombardi\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Access form reference in python form actions ¶ The form instance, or QgsAttributeForm object, has now been exposed to the Python API for Drag and drop form actions.\nThis means that QGIS users can now reference the current form and produce actions that change values within the form itself, such as resetting default values or quick actions for applying other user defined presets.\nThis implementation has been done in line with QEP 251\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Allow drag and drop forms label font and color customization ¶ The font and color of form labels and group or tabs titles can now be customized in the Drag \u0026amp; Drop from designer interface.\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Collapse form group by expression ¶ New configuration options are now available for Drag \u0026amp; Drop form group boxes which allow specifying an expression to define whether a form group should be collapsed.\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: \u0026quot;Keep disjoint features separate\u0026quot; option for dissolve algorithm ¶ A \u0026quot;Keep disjoint features separate\u0026quot; option has been added for the dissolve algorithm which will cause features and parts that do not overlap or touch to be exported as separate features instead of parts of a single multipart feature. This makes it much simpler to perform simple aggregation based dissolves on a single class.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Raise message model tool ¶ A raise message algorithm has been added to the model tools which allows users to output additional information in models logs. This prevents the abuse of the raise error/warning algorithms and provides more granular control of model logging levels.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Run batch processing steps in tasks ¶ Individual steps from the batch processing dialog now run as a separate task whenever possible. Although individual steps are still run sequentially rather than parallel, this keeps the UI responsive, and permits responsive cancellation and progress reporting.\nThis feature was funded by NRCan Contract#3000739399\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Background processing of model algorithms ¶ Previously, any graphical models designed in Processing would be forced to run on the main thread, and did not support background execution. QGIS now supports running model algorithms off the main thread so that they can safely be run in background tasks.\nThis feature was funded by NRCan Contract#3000739399\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Allow setting Examples in graphical model help ¶ A new 'Examples' section has been added to the graphical model help editor dialog, allowing users to enter their own custom examples to help explain usage of the model.\nMore instructive help is now shown for models in the qgis_process tool, including outputting any example help which has been set.\nThis feature was funded by NRCan Contract#3000739399\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Overlay tools with multiple overlay layers support ¶ Adds new Intersect, Union and Difference tools which support multiple \u0026quot;overlay\u0026quot; inputs instead of a single overlay layer. The current workflow includes selecting the order of overlay layers used in the operation, which are used in an iterative process by using the output of an operation between two layers as an input for the same operation with the next layer.\nThis is a useful abstraction which can be utilized in various scenarios, such as processing models where iterative processes or loops may be limited.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Project elevation properties framework ¶ Elevation/terrain settings are now project-level settings, which are defined through the Project Properties, Terrain tab, in line with QEP 246 and in order to support the new elevation profile tools.\nThis framework provides configuration options for:\nFlat terrain with a configurable terrain height setting DEM (Raster Layer) with settings for defining the source raster layer, vertical scale and offset Mesh with settings for defining the source mesh layer, vertical scale and offset This feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Optionally store UI configuration in projects ¶ An opt-in setting for projects has been added for \u0026quot;Remember attribute table windows and docks between sessions\u0026quot;. If checked for a project, then any opened attribute tables will be saved into the project and immediately restored when loading that project.\nThis has been designed to improve workflows when a user has constructed a project with a particular set of attribute table configurations for their requirements, and re-setting up these attribute tables is a hassle.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Optionally store layer edit state in projects ¶ An opt-in setting has been added to project properties for \u0026quot;Remember editable layer status between sessions\u0026quot;. If checked, then any layers which are editable will be remembered when saving that project and immediately made editable whenever the project is restored to make it simpler for users who are making complex, data-editing focused projects to store their configurations on a project by project basis.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Project style databases support ¶ A new feature allows users to set a list of QGIS style databases for a project. This allows projects to link to multiple style databases, and then show all symbols and entities from those databases in the layer styling interface.\nThe style paths can point to style .db databases or .xml exports. When a project is loaded, symbol and label style selectors will show ALL symbols from ALL styles linked to the project. Additionally, every project now has a project-specific style database (which is stored alongside the project), for storing project-specific symbols, text formats, etc.\nThis functionality requires a QGIS build based on Qt 5.13 or later, and is hidden on older builds (e.g. on Ubuntu 20.04)\nThis feature was funded by the QGIS Swiss user group.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Added setting to show feature counts by default for newly added layers ¶ If enabled, this option will cause the feature count to be enabled for any newly added/created map layers. This setting will remain disabled by default.\nThis feature was funded by SevenCs GmbH\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Add a \u0026quot;Skip\u0026quot; option for custom environmental variables ¶ The QGIS settings allow a particular user profile to modify the system environment variables for enhanced flexibility, in Settings --\u0026gt; Options --\u0026gt; Environment.\nThis functionality included options for \u0026quot;Overwrite\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;If Undefined\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Unset\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Prepend\u0026quot;, and \u0026quot;Append\u0026quot;, which allowed users to perform various functions from configuring credentials to extending their PATH variables.\nA new \u0026quot;Skip\u0026quot; option is now provided which allows users to ignore values from an existing field, without losing the stored values or having to remove them from the settings to disable them.\nThis feature was developed by Andrea Giudiceandrea\nFeature: Revamped projects' default symbols, color ramp, and text format ¶ This new version of QGIS has revamped the way default projects symbols are handled, aiming at upgrading its UI/UX as well as behaving correctly in multi-user environments. The changes include:\nProjects' default symbols and color ramps are now stored as symbology XML rather than references, improving portability and integration with external applications and services A new project-level default text format setting has been added to allow user defined configuration of the default project font for newly-added vector layers The user interface has been upgraded to make use of QGIS' symbol and color ramp buttons This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nProfile Plots ¶ Feature: Elevation profile plotting tool ¶ QGIS now includes a native elevation profile plotting tool.\nThe tool includes the following features:\nSupport for vector, raster, mesh, and point cloud layers, based on the corresponding layer's elevation settings. Drawing profile lines interactively using a map tool, which supports snapping, tracing, stream digitizing and curves Picking an existing line feature to use as the profile line. When this tool is active, users can click any line feature on the map to generate a profile curve along that line. If multiple features are present at the clicked point then a popup menu will appear allowing users to select from the available features. Plots can be exported to PDF (as high quality vector objects) or various image formats Profiles are rendered using standard QGIS line symbols, and so include support for advanced design and configuration, including support for geometry generators and paint effects. Measuring distances on the plots Identifying features in the plot via either a single click, or click-and-drag rectangle. Results are shown in the standard identify results dock, and support vector, raster, mesh, and point cloud layers. Interactive navigation of the plot canvas is supported using the standard QGIS pan/zoom shortcuts, such as:\nMiddle mouse button: Pan Space: Pan Ctrl + Space: Zoom Ctrl + Mouse wheel: Fine zoom Shortcuts are available for nudging the elevation profile curve left and right, which allows users to \u0026quot;scrub\u0026quot; the curve across the map frame and find the optimal profile line. The step distance is set to match the chart's tolerance distance, so that a single step will result in a different set of point and point cloud features shown in the chart.\nKeyboard shortcuts for nudging are:\nCtrl+Alt+,: Scrub left Ctrl+Alt+.: Scrub right For more information on this awesome feature and framework, be sure to watch the QGIS Elevation Profiles Deep Dive presentation on YouTube.\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Flexible vector layer symbology in elevation profiles ¶ Vector layers added to profile charts will default to respecting their layer symbology. A checkbox has been added to disable this in the layer elevation properties.\nThis means that vector results in elevation profile charts will default to showing features using their corresponding 2D renderer, so custom styles such as categorized classes will be visible on the profile chart by default.\nThere's also options to change the interpretation of the elevation profile for vector layers. By default, the elevation profile tool will use an \u0026quot;individual features\u0026quot; option, which samples discrete positions where the cross section profile line intersects the vector features. There's also a \u0026quot;continuous surface\u0026quot; option which will generate an interpretation of the surface by interpolating across the sample positions for enhanced visualization, such as the production of a continuous surface line from contour lines or surveyed elevation points.\nAdditional rendering capabilities are provided for the \u0026quot;continuous surface\u0026quot; interpretation option, such as a \u0026quot;fill below\u0026quot; symbol style. This can be easier to interpret in some cases, and helps match expected symbology conventions in certain disciplines.\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Flexible symbology for point cloud profile plotting ¶ Point cloud layers in profile charts include the following symbology features:\nSingle color display of points or a setting to inherit classification and coloring from the 2D symbology (e.g. RGB colors) Respecting the profile curve distance tolerance setting Option to reduce the opacity of points which are further from the profile curve Automatic refinement based on plot visible area and scale, with a user controllable max screen error Control over appearance of points (color, size and shape) This feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: Vector feature extrusion for profile charts ¶ The elevation profile tool provides support for vector feature extrusion and offset heights for incorporation of 2D vector in profile charts. These propertied can be data defined, and will also be used as the default offset/extrusion settings for any new 3D polygon symbols created for that layer.\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding for raster and point clouds improvements\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Rename bookmark groups context menu control ¶ Creating new spatial bookmarks from the browser will now default to the \u0026quot;project bookmark\u0026quot; category, and a new context menu option has been added for renaming of bookmark groups. The existing behavior of renaming bookmark groups using the F2 key remains unchanged.\nThis feature was funded by Camptocamp\nThis feature was developed by Ismail Sunni\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Support reading ESRI vector tile packages (.vtpk) files directly ¶ ESRI vector tile packages (VTPK files) can now be opened directly as vector tile layers via drag and drop, including support for style translation.\nThis feature was funded by North Road Consulting, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road Consulting)\nFeature: SQL Logging in the Debugging/Development panel ¶ The debugging/development panel now includes support for logging the SQL queries made by QGIS to backend data providers.\nThis provides an effective method of debugging algorithms and data providers, as well as capturing the SQL statements made to perform specific actions against particular providers.\nNote that this is specifically designed to be used as a debugging and development tool and is not designed to be a replacement for any logging capabilities on the backend databases systems.\nThis has been implemented in line with QEP 242.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Alternate periodic check strategy for detecting project updates ¶ QGIS Server now provides an alternate lastModified() strategy for invalidating the internal project cache, addressing concerns about the ability of QGIS server to invalidate the cache when a project file is updated on atypical file systems, such as NFS, or when the project file is stored in a database system like PostgreSQL.\nAn asynchronous periodic check strategy using the last modified value of a project is now provided for checking project configuration for changes.\nThe QGIS_SERVER_PROJECT_CACHE_STRATEGY environment variable may be used to configure the server caching strategy using the following values:\nperiodic for the alternative strategy filesystem to use the file system watcher strategy off to disable internal caching completely. QGIS_SERVER_PROJECT_CACHE_CHECK_INTERVAL is used for controlling the periodic strategy interval.\nThe QFileSystemWatcher strategy remains the default configuration.\nThis feature was funded by 3Liz\nThis feature was developed by David Marteau\nFeature: Add more server highlight label parameters ¶ New parameters have been added to better control the placement of highlight labels on the WMS server, including:\nHIGHLIGHT_LABELDISTANCE: Distance between the feature and the label, defined in mm HIGHLIGHT_LABELROTATION: Label rotation, defined in degrees HIGHLIGHT_LABELVALI: Vertical alignment for placing the label directly on a point HIGHLIGHT_LABELHALI: Horizontal alignment for placing the label directly on a point This feature was developed by mhugent\nFeature: Temporal properties support for WMS Server ¶ Prior releases of QGIS Server only provided support for the dimensions of time and elevation for vector layers and provided no integration with the updated temporal properties API provided by QGIS.\nQGIS Server has now been extended to support the time dimension in the GetCapabilities response for WMS services, and accept a TIME query string parameter which provides capacity for temporal data filtering.\nParsing time values will be performed with the implementation specification provided by OGC API - Features (OAPIF) and use the following structure:\n| interval| syntax | |---|---| | interval-closed | date-time \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; date-time | | interval-open-start | [\u0026quot;..\u0026quot;] \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; date-time | | interval-open-end | date-time \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; [\u0026quot;..\u0026quot;] | | interval | interval-closed / interval-open-start / interval-open-end | | datetime | date-time / interval |\nNote that this filtering applies to single values only, and a list of instants or ranges is not currently supported.\nTo prevent conflict with existing TIME dimension stipulations on legacy projects, if a TIME dimension was explicitly defined for a vector layer, the temporal properties for that layer will not be activated and the explicitly set TIME dimension will be considered instead.\nThis feature was funded by Gis3W\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Add a QgsScaleCalculator function to calculate canvas width from a given extent, scale, and dpi ¶ A new calculateCanvasWidth( extent, scale ) was added to the QgsScaleCalculator class to derive canvas width in pixel unit when providing an extent, a scale, and a DPI.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Clear current symbol action in symbol button widget ¶ A set to null / clear current symbol action has been added to clear the current symbol attached to a symbol button widget.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nNotable Fixes ¶ Bug fixes by Even Rouault ¶ Bug Title URL Issues (if reported, Github) URL Commit (Github) 3.22 backport commit (GitHub) WFS provider doesn't recognize CRS strings other than OGC URNs #46485 PR #48550 N/A QgsMapCanvas::showEvent access violation / QGIS crash #48438 PR #48551 PR #48558 [GDAL provider] Minimal support for GDT_Int64/GDT_UInt64 of GDAL 3.5.0 (not reported) PR #48553 access to QgsRubberBand-methods crashes QGis #48471 PR #48554 PR #48561 annotationManager with access to canvas-items crashes QGis #48436 PR #48554 PR #48561 Can not import excel File with new version of QGIS #47838 N/A - freexl bug.

It is also set to introduce the long-awaited features provided by previous releases into the long-term support release, as outlined in the QGIS Roadmap.\nThe splash screen features a rare and extraordinary 1847 map of Firenze, or Florence, Italy by Giuseppe Molini. This magnificently engraved map was originally drawn in 1731 by the Florentine architect Ferdinando Ruggieri. Oriented to the south, the map covers the old walled center of Florence as it extends on both sides of the Arno River. The upper right quadrant features the lily symbol of Florence. Though printed in 1847, this map has been prepared in the 17th-century style by copperplate engraving on thick-laid paper. Firenze in 1847 was on the cusp of political transformation. One year following the production of this rare map the Grand Duke of Tuscany, responding to political demonstrations throughout Florence, granted Tuscany its first constitution.\nFor a whirlwind tour of all the new functionalities introduced, you can view the highlight reel video on YouTube at https://youtu.be/IEkOhQezQMk\nWe would also like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible. From the QGIS community, we hope you enjoy this release!

algorithms Application and Project Options Feature: Modified project coordinate and bearing display settings Feature: Add support for \u0026quot;user\u0026quot; fonts, and automatic downloading of freely licensed fonts Browser Feature: Implement relationship discovery for OGR layers, and show relationships in browser Feature: Modified UX for Geopackage and ESRI File Geodatabase creation Feature: Allow drag and drop of vector layers to non-GPKG OGR database datasets Feature: Expose field domain management for non-gpkg OGR sources Data Providers Feature: Define session role for PostgreSQL connections Feature: Automatically add related tables when adding layers from GDAL datasets with embedded relationship information Feature: Add subset string (filter) support for arcgis REST layers Feature: Abstract database provider for renaming fields Feature: WFS performing binary spatial operations in expressions on server Feature: Editing ArcGIS REST Layers Feature: Load raster sublayers from vector tile styles automatically Feature: Add WMS layers individually Feature: Save projects to Oracle Database Provider QGIS Server Feature: QGIS_SERVER_ALLOWED_EXTRA_SQL_TOKENS settings variable Feature: Open layers in a read only mode with QGIS Server Plugins Feature: Changes to plugin automatic updates behaviour Programmability Feature: Add temporal handling to maps in QGIS Quick Feature: Addition of py-args command line parameter Notable Fixes Feature: Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti Feature: Bug fixes by Even Rouault Feature: Bug fixes by Julien Cabieces Feature: Bug fixes by Paul Blottiere Feature: Bug fixes by Sandro Santilli Feature: Bug fixes by Nyall Dawson Feature: Bug fixes by Loïc Bartoletti Breaking Changes ¶ Feature: Drop project backward compatibility for symbology with QGIS 3.16 and older ¶ Previous releases of QGIS would write significant amounts of compatibility objects into the XML structure of project files to maintain backward compatibility for symbologies in order to allow project files to be opened with QGIS 3.16 and older. This compatibility has been removed from future releases, providing significant optimizations to the project file structure.\nTemporal ¶ Feature: Add temporal manager support for WMTS layers with TIME dimension ¶ This enhancement exposes any WMTS \u0026quot;time\u0026quot; dimensions for use in the temporal framework, including allowing these layers to be animated and controlled via the temporal controller.\nWhen we do detect a time dimension on a WMTS layer, we no longer expose this in the same way as other non-time dimensions. The browser panel does not show the dimension values, and adding the layer via Data Source Manager no longer prompts the user to pick from the available time values. Instead, these layers are indicated with a new \u0026quot;time capable raster layer\u0026quot; icon, and are added to a project without the user specifying a time value.\nJust like a WMS(T) layer, when a time-dimension enabled WMTS layer is added to the project, it will default to the \u0026quot;automatic\u0026quot; temporal mode, meaning that the layer will follow the temporal controller's current time range by default. A user can then opt to show a specific static time value for the layer through the layer's Temporal properties page, by unchecking \u0026quot;Dynamic Temporal Control\u0026quot; and picking a specific available time range from the \u0026quot;Predefined date\u0026quot; option.\nThis should unify the user experience so that the usage of WMTS time-enabled layers is essentially identical to the usage of WMS(T) layers.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nMap Tools ¶ Feature: Allow selecting features in vector tile layers ¶ Support for selecting features from vector tile layers has been added, which allows users to use the standard map-based selection tools to interactively select features from these sources.\nWhen a vector tile layer has a selection, a user can:\nCopy the features and paste them to other layers, or paste them into a scratch layer Use other (non-editing) tools which operate on selections, such as \u0026quot;zoom to selected features\u0026quot;/\u0026quot;pan to selected features\u0026quot; Selections can be made using any of the interactive map-based selection tools, e.g. select by rectangle, freehand, polygon, or radius. All the shortcuts which apply to vector selections for adding/subtracting/intersecting selections also apply.\nSelecting features is made using the tile zoom level of the canvas, and then the features selected at this zoom level persist even if the user changes the map scale to another vector tile zoom level. This means a user can zoom in and select a small/ detailed feature, then zoom out and still see the selected feature on the map.\nThis feature was funded by Toitū Te Whenua Land Information New Zealand\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Exclusive window based UX for data source manager ¶ The data source manager dialog is now ALWAYS non modal, and options to set it as such have been removed. The dialog now functions just like other \u0026quot;manager\u0026quot; type windows in QGIS, such as the style manager or layout manager.\nThe data source manager will instead be treated as its own window, which is raised to the foreground whenever the Data Source Manager button is pressed.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add a Show in Attribute Table action to the right click menu of legend class symbols ¶ A new \u0026quot;Show in Attribute Table\u0026quot; action has been added to the right-click context menu of legend class symbols in the table of contents. This allows users to open the attribute table with a filter applied to match only the features relevant to a particular symbol group. This provides a significant performance improvement for certain datasets, such as large vector layers loaded from a remote source.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Add setting to hide NULL values on identify result ¶ The \u0026quot;Identify Features\u0026quot; utility now provides the capability to hide NULL values from the returned results\nThis feature was funded by Camptocamp\nThis feature was developed by Ismail Sunni\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Allow control over GPS location marker ¶ A new general GPS options page has been introduced which includes new settings for controlling the marker symbol used for the current GPS location, and whether this symbol should be rotated to match the GPS direction.\nThis feature was funded by Tiwi Resources, Bush Heritage, Australian Wildlife Conservancy\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Added new ellipse marker shapes ¶ The symbol styles for the ellipse marker type now include additional shape types for:\nPentagon Hexagon Octagon Third Circle Quarter Circle Star This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by ZayneTomlins\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Add support for HTML bold/italic/font size and font family to labelling ¶ Support for additional HTML formatting tags have been added for use within labeling (and everywhere else the text renderer is used).\nSupported tags specifically include:\nfont family font size bold italic This feature was funded by the Swiss QGIS user group\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add option to use absolute units for line height ¶ Previously, the line height was always set in multiples of the text line spacing, however, it is now possible to use absolute units for line height (useful in contexts where mixed text sizes are used within a single document).\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nMesh ¶ Feature: Add option to reload mesh layer temporal properties ¶ An \u0026quot;Always take reference time from data source\u0026quot; option has been added for mesh layers that when checked, will ensure that the reference time is reloaded from the data source, and each time the layer is reloaded or the project reopened the time properties will be updated from the file automatically.\nIn previous releases, when a mesh layer file had a reference time and time extent that changed, the time layer properties would not be updated when the projector layer are reloaded, and the user would be required to manually navigate to the \u0026quot;Reload from provider\u0026quot; feature in the temporal tab of the layer properties.\nThis feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Ambient Occlusion 3D Effect ¶ A new ambient occlusion effect is available for rendering data in 3D views that is useful for improving depth perception of the data in 3D. This is a post-processing effect and it can be even combined with eye dome lighting (EDL) for quite interesting results. An oversimplification of the effect is that features that are not visible to the camera are used to texture and darken neighboring elements, with the benefit of improving contrast, feature definition, and differentiation.\nThere is a new item for controlling the state of Ambient Occlusion in the configuration menu for 3D views, as well as extra parameters in the advanced section of the configuration dialog for fine-grained control over:\nRadius: The distance threshold for calculating ambient occlusion Intensity: The strength of the effect should be (higher values make things darker) Occlusion threshold: Number of neighboring points that need to be occluded for the effect to appear (values lower than 50% will make the output darker, but possibly provide a greater range of occlusion) This feature was developed by Martin Dobias \u0026amp; Belgacem Nedjima\nPoint Clouds ¶ Feature: Point Cloud Layer Export ¶ Point Cloud layers now support being exported to vector or point cloud data formats, with optional filtering.\nSupported formats include:\nTemporary scratch layer (memory layer) GeoPackage Shapefile DXF LAZ (requires build WITH_PDAL) Uncompressed LAS files Export operations support filtering by:\nExtent Filtering by Z Range Limiting the number of exported points Filtering spatially by polygon layer In addition, output CRS definition and re-projection are also supported.\nThis feature was funded by State of Vorarlberg and Swiss QGIS user group\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis\nFeature: Eye Dome Lighting for point clouds in 2D map canvas ¶ The eye dome lighting effect is now available for point clouds in 2D renderers\nThis feature was developed by Nedjima Belgacem\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Add FORCE_RASTER and IMAGE_COMPRESSION parameters to PDF algorithms ¶ The FORCE_RASTER and IMAGE_COMPRESSION parameters have been added to the various \u0026quot;Export print layout as PDF\u0026quot; algorithms, including support for Atlas and multifile exports.\nFORCE_RASTER is mutually exclusive with and takes precedence over the FORCE_VECTOR parameter.\nThis feature was developed by Andrea Giudiceandrea\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Add new variable form of current feature expression functions ¶ The newer style variable form has been added for referencing the current feature and its attributes in expressions.\nThe newly introduced variables are:\n@feature: a replacement for $currentfeature, contains the current feature @id: a replacement for $id, contains the current feature id @geometry: a replacement for $geometry, contains the current feature geometry This is a step towards eventually deprecating the older $ style functions, and providing a more consistent approach to expressions instead of an unpredictable mix of @/$.\nOlder functions and variable references will continue to work (and will likely continue working indefinitely for the sake of compatibility with older projects). They will also continue (for the time being) to be exposed in the UI to avoid user confusion.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add new shared_paths function ¶ A new shared_paths function has been added which returns a collection containing paths shared by the two input geometries. Those going in the same direction are in the first element of the collection, and those going in the opposite direction are in the second element. The paths themselves are given in the direction of the first geometry.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Make_valid and geom_to_array functions ¶ Additional functions have been added for:\nmake_valid: Repair broken input geometries and returns the corrected geometries geometries_to_array: This converts a geometry collection into an array for easier handling and iteration This feature was developed by Alex\nFeature: Concave hull function ¶ A new concave_hull function is now available in QGIS expressions (GEOS 3.11+)\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti\nFeature: Ask for confirmation when discarding expression changes ¶ A new confirmation dialog is now safeguarding users against accidentally discarding their unapplied changes in expression editor dialogs. This safeguard is used in the Expression String Builder, the Expression Dialog (Epsilon icon, e. g. for Geometry Generators or for Pre-calculated Values in the model builder) and the Expression Based Filter (Attribute Table -\u0026gt; Advanced filter expression).\nThis feature was funded by WhereGroup GmbH\nThis feature was developed by Johannes Kröger\nData Management ¶ Feature: Ask for confirmation when deleting features ¶ A new confirmation dialog appears by default when users perform an action that would delete records, such as using the DEL key or toolbar actions, to further reduce the risks of accidental feature deletion. Additionally, the feature count is now included in the dialog message itself (and is also still displayed in the title bar), making the total number of features deleted more clear to users.\nIn previous releases, similar confirmation prompts would only be displayed when some features fell out of the extent of the map canvas, or the deletion triggered the removal of child relation features. The new behavior is for the prompt to be enabled by default and disabled by using the \u0026quot;Don't show this message again\u0026quot; checkbox.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS user group Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nMetadata and Metasearch ¶ Feature: Layer metadata data provider search and storage ¶ Implementation of elements from the QEP #250 \u0026quot;Database metadata storage\u0026quot; initiative have been completed and this functionality includes the creation of a new layer metadata API and GUI components.\nThe following data providers/formats are supported for storing and managing layer metadata in QGIS:\nGPKG (it was implemented already, I just wrapped it into the new API) Postgres Postgres Raster In addition, a new layer metadata search tab is available from the data source manager, and an interactive layer metadata search is available using the QGIS locator.\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Fixed precision support for select processing tools ¶ A new advanced parameter is available for some processing tools which allows the use of the fixed precision parameter provided by GEOS \u0026gt;= 3.9.0. This parameter is listed under advanced parameters as \u0026quot;Grid Size\u0026quot; and is currently supported in the following tools:\nOverlap Intersection Difference Symmetrical Difference Union This feature was funded by Orange Telecom FR\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti\nFeature: Improved \u0026quot;Make Valid\u0026quot; Algorithms ¶ QGIS can now use the newer refined GEOS 3.10+ methods for validating and repairing geometry features.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Default option to show feature count for vector outputs from processing ¶ A new Show feature count for output vector layers setting is available (but disabled by default for performance reasons), which will automatically enable the \u0026quot;show feature count\u0026quot; option on output layers loaded from QGIS processing. This is able to give users a first glimpse of what to expect as an output from a Processing algorithm.\nThis feature was developed by Germap\nFeature: Add relations export option to package layers algorithm ¶ The \u0026quot;Package Layers\u0026quot; processing tool now supports optionally following project relations and exporting related tables following the hierarchy both upstream and downstream, whilst also taking selected features into account.\nThis feature was funded by ARPA Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Add \u0026quot;Offset\u0026quot; parameter to \u0026quot;Drape\u0026quot; algorithms ¶ Adds the \u0026quot;Offset\u0026quot; parameter to the \u0026quot;Drape (set Z value from raster)\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Set M value from raster\u0026quot; algorithms. The \u0026quot;Offset\u0026quot; value is algebraically added to the band values after applying the \u0026quot;Scale factor\u0026quot;.\nThis feature was developed by Andrea Giudiceandrea\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Modified project coordinate and bearing display settings ¶ The Coordinate and Bearing Display options in the project settings have been updated in line with the following:\nMap Units (behavior is the same as previous releases) Map Geographic (modified behavior) Custom Projection Units (new type) The legacy Geographic (Latitude/ Longitude) option would display values in the map CRS coordinates if the CRS was geographic, otherwise, it would transform coordinates to a hard-coded WGS84 CRS value.\nThe updated Map Geographic (degrees) option, which supersedes the legacy approach, will display values in the map CRS coordinates if the CRS is geographic, however in instances where it is not, the internal QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::toGeographicCrs() API will be used to transform the coordinates into the map CRS' associated geographic CRS. This is helpful in various contexts, such as when analyzing non-earth celestial bodies.\nThe Custom Projection Units type is a new addition that defaults to WGS84 and allows users to set any CRS they desire as display coordinates.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Add support for \u0026quot;user\u0026quot; fonts, and automatic downloading of freely licensed fonts ¶ A new \u0026quot;Fonts\u0026quot; panel has been added to the settings dialog, which provides support for the following functionalities:\nThe ability for users to populate a list of automatic font replacements to apply when loading projects or styles, allowing better support for projects and styles to be used across different operating systems (e.g. replace \u0026quot;Arial\u0026quot; with \u0026quot;Helvetica\u0026quot;). Users can now place TTF or OTF fonts in the \u0026quot;fonts\u0026quot; subfolder of their user profile. These fonts will automatically be loaded at QGIS startup time. This provides a way for users to use fonts without requiring them to be installed on an operating system level, which is often blocked in enterprise environments. The Fonts setting panel lists all installed user fonts and allows users to manage (i.e. remove) previously installed user fonts An API is provided for other tools, such as plugins and other clients, to specify additional user font folders which should be scanned during QGIS startup Automatic downloading of missing fonts is now supported in certain circumstances. If a user opens a project or style, or they try to load a vector tile layer that references fonts that aren't currently available, then a hard-coded list of freely licensed fonts to download via URL is consulted to determine whether it's possible to automatically download the font to the user font directory (and notify the user of the font license). A setting to opt out of this behavior is provided in the Fonts panel if so desired. This feature was funded by Toitū Te Whenua Land Information New Zealand\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Implement relationship discovery for OGR layers, and show relationships in browser ¶ The Project Properties → Relations → Discover Relations feature is now able to support OGR layers that support relationships, such GeoPackage (via the related tables extension) and ESRI FileGeodatabases.\nThe QGIS Browser Panel now includes the ability to show detailed relationship information for these data sources.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Modified UX for Geopackage and ESRI File Geodatabase creation ¶ A \u0026quot;New ESRI File Geodatabase\u0026quot; action has been added to the QGIS Browser right-click context menu on directories, and a new \u0026quot;vacuum\u0026quot; action is available for GDB files. (requires GDAL 3.6+)\nAdditionally, creating a new Geopackage from the same menu will now immediately create an empty GPKG, rather than the legacy behavior of opening a table creation dialog by default (and requiring table creation or users to input dummy data).\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1829991/178902332-0e112e73-0140-45b9-84bf-fc7875cb7b98.gif\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow drag and drop of vector layers to non-GPKG OGR database datasets ¶ QGIS now allows drag and drop of vector layers between OGR database datasets that are not stored in GPKG format, for instance, the dragging of a layer onto a GDB to import that dataset into the geodatabase\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Expose field domain management for non-gpkg OGR sources ¶ The QGIS browser now supports more advanced functionalities for OGR databases that are not in GPKG format, including Field domain management capabilities (creation and listing domains) and table creation. This means that users can manage field domains and create new tables in an existing ESRI FileGeodatabase database from the QGIS Browser interface.\nThis feature was funded by Provincie Gelderland\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Define session role for PostgreSQL connections ¶ A session_role setting can now be specified for PostgreSQL connections to set the user identifier of the active SQL session. Permissions checking for SQL commands are then carried out with the associated named role.\nThis is highly useful in instances where it is desirable to automatically give ownership of new objects (Tables/ Views/ Functions etc.) to the session_role group, and share ownership and the associated rights with all members of the session_role group.\nThe specified session_role must be a role that the current session user is a member of, or if the session user is a superuser, any role can be selected.\nThis feature was funded by 3liz\nThis feature was developed by rldhont\nFeature: Automatically add related tables when adding layers from GDAL datasets with embedded relationship information ¶ For GDAL data formats with embedded relationship information, whenever a table is added QGIS is now able to discover relationships and immediately add all the related tables to the current project (if they don't already exist). Additionally, when adding these related layers QGIS will automatically configure the corresponding QGIS relationships.\nThis works for all formats which support the GDAL relationship API, which include:\nGeopackage (via the related tables extension) ESRI FileGDB/ OpenFileGDB ESRI Personal Geodatabase SQLite/ Spatialite formats. This feature was funded by University of Uppsala\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add subset string (filter) support for arcgis REST layers ¶ This can greatly improve the performance on large layers!\nThis feature was funded by Naturstyrelsen and Miljøstyrelsen, Danish Ministry of Environment\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Abstract database provider for renaming fields ¶ A QgsAbstractDatabaseProviderConnection interface has been added for supporting renaming fields, and implemented for OGR connections along with the ability to rename existing fields for supported database connections via the QGIS Browser interface.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: WFS performing binary spatial operations in expressions on server ¶ QGIS used to be able to perform the expression filters of binary spatial operations on the server when the geometry was provided as WKT or in the GML format. This change converts the geometry from being a static variable in the expression to an OGC filter. The WFS URL is then created by combining a bounding box rectangle, layer filter, and the filtering expression.\nA feature request computes the expression in advance to find out if it can be performed on the server, then it's stored in QgsBackgroundCachedSharedData where a new download is triggered.\nWhen a filter request is not a pure binary spatial operation, it will not be evaluated on the server.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Schaffhausen\nThis feature was developed by signedav\nFeature: Editing ArcGIS REST Layers ¶ QGIS now supports the editing of ArcGIS feature server layers, such as those hosted on ArcGIS online. Assuming the user has appropriate permissions granted for editing a layer, it will unlock the ability to use the native QGIS tools to edit that layer. These changes include support for the following operations:\nDeleting features Adding new features Curved geometries (only supported for enterprise ArcGIS server, as ArcGIS online currently has no support for curves) Modifying existing features Modifying attributes (creating fields, deleting fields, creating attribute indexes) This feature was funded by Naturstyrelsen and Miljøstyrelsen, Danish Ministry of Environment\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Load raster sublayers from vector tile styles automatically ¶ When loading a new vector tile source into a project, if the associated MapBox GL style includes any raster sublayers, then also load those into the project with converted styles.\nFixes https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/46593\nThis feature was funded by Toitū Te Whenua Land Information New Zealand\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add WMS layers individually ¶ In previous releases, the selection of layers from WMS Servers would be loaded into QGIS as a single project layer. This new functionality provides an optional checkbox to load each of the selected WMS layers into QGIS as distinct project layers.\nThis feature was funded by Camptocamp\nThis feature was developed by Ismail Sunni\nFeature: Save projects to Oracle Database Provider ¶ QGIS now supports saving projects to Oracle databases.\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: QGIS_SERVER_ALLOWED_EXTRA_SQL_TOKENS settings variable ¶ This new feature allows specifying extra tokens which may be used for a WMS FILTER definition. The current list of accepted tokens is rather small and this setting will allow system administrators to easily enlarge the list of allowed tokens.\nThis feature was funded by Zweckverband Grevesmühlen\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Open layers in a read only mode with QGIS Server ¶ A new QGIS_SERVER_FORCE_READONLY_LAYERS environment variable to force QGIS Server to open layers in read-only mode.\nThis includes various underlying API changes to support read-only configuration for data provider construction, project structure, and layer properties.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by rldhont\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Changes to plugin automatic updates behaviour ¶ This change moves the old app/plugin_installer/checkOnStart setting key to a new plugins/automatically-check-for-updates key, and switches the default value to enable automatic checks.\nThis is designed to switch all existing QGIS users to the new default behavior of checking for plugin updates at startup (at a maximum of once every 3 days).\nIt is intended to offer a better QGIS experience to our users, by proactively informing all users when plugins should be updated, ensuring that ALL users are more likely to upgrade plugins and get the bug fixes for plugins promptly.\nEnterprise users who have customised this setting in their deployments will need to adapt their scripts for the new setting key.\nAdditionally, the option to control the number of days between plugin startup checks has been removed and is hardcoded at 3 days.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Add temporal handling to maps in QGIS Quick ¶ A new implementation has been added to allow the Canvas and Map Settings in QGIS Quick to handle temporal functionality.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Addition of py-args command line parameter ¶ When running QGIS from the command line with the --code parameter, a new --py-args utility allows the passing of arguments to the python interpreter.\nArguments between --py-args and -- are passed to the python interpreter and ignored by QGIS, so for example, when using the following command:\nqgis --code /home/user/example.py --py-args --specialScriptArguments \u0026quot;arg1\u0026quot; 'arg2' -- layer1 layer2 The example.py script will have --specialScriptArguments, arg1, and arg2 passed as system arguments to the python interpreter, whilst layer1 and layer2 will be handled by QGIS normally and loaded as map layers\nThis feature was funded by Landesamt für Vermessung und Geoinformation Vorarlberg\nThis feature was developed by Damiano Lombardi\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.22 backport commit (GitHub) GetPrint request of Atlas Template doesn't respect Project scales #49900 PR #50199 PR #50214 Attribute Table Integer entries not showing due to window size #50181 PR #50201 Not recommended WFS3 collections field name/displayName mix in request/response #49399 PR #50203 Not recommended QGIS Server WMS GetFeatureInfo does not evaluate represent_value expression in maptip #30719 PR #50216 PR #50223 \u0026quot;evaluate default value on providers side\u0026quot;

It is part of a series of 1200 maps of all the communities in The Netherlands from that time, which were published in an atlas for each of the 11 regions. All maps were drawn in the same size, although for large municipalities a double format was used and scaled to match the page. The series was internationally rewarded because of its accuracy and completeness. The map was drawn by Jacob Kuyper (1821-1908), the most famous geographer and cartographer of his time in The Netherlands. Text and splash map image provided by atlasandmap.com\nThe native GeoNode integration has also been migrated to an external plugin, leveraging the powerful extensions to the QGIS API for plugins implemented in recent releases.\nUsers can also look forward to new functionality and UX enhancements, including support for raster attribute tables, intelligent and configurable sorting for layer loading, improvements to GPS utilities, more dynamic form widgets, native rich media previews for attachments, better integration with cloud services, extensions to the QGIS metadata standards, and a host of other noteworthy additions.\nFor a whirlwind tour of all the new functionalities introduced, you can view the highlight reel video on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7O819lFKc4\nQGIS is a community effort, and we would like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible.

This compatibility has been removed from future releases.\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nMap Tools ¶ Feature: Raster MapTips ¶ in previous releases, MapTips were only available for vector layers, but new API changes have made it possible to implement MapTips for other layer types.\nRaster layers now support MapTips, and new expression utility functions have been added to extend the existing MapTips capabilities:\nmap_to_html_table: converts a map (key-value pair data structure) to an HTML table map_to_html_dl: converts a map (key-value pair data structure) to an HTML definition list raster_attributes: creates a map with the fields names as keys and the raster attribute table values as values from the attribute table entry that matches the given raster value a new \u0026quot;Map Layer Position\u0026quot; expression scope that defines a variable @layer_cursor_point with the layer coordinates (in the layer's CRS) under the mouse position This feature was funded by NOAA OCS Hydrography\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Identify on mouse move, no mouse click ¶ A new option allows for the use of the identify tool to be triggered on mouse movement, without needing to click on the canvas.\nThis option behaves almost identically to the default identify option, with the difference being that the user doesn't need to click or use a keyboard shortcut to trigger the identify action. This allows the identify tool to function similar to the MapTips utility, whilst providing users with the benefits of the identify tool such as support for multiple layer types and derived information.\nThe default trigger is a 300-millisecond timer which will execute the identify action, which is implemented to avoid performance issues when moving the mouse.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Constraint based functionality for attribute tables ¶ New constraint-based conditional styling and failing constraints feature filters have been exposed within the attribute table.\nThis functionality provides filtering options to view or hide features that have failing (hard or soft) constraints, and introduces a new conditional styling type that works alongside the pre-existing row and field types to highlight features which fail to meet the layer constraints.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Additional GPS information panel and toolbar fields ¶ The GPS information panel now includes the current total track length, and the distance from start of track. These features are also available as a (not-on-by-default) option which allows them to be shown in the GPS toolbar information label.\nThe GPS information panel also includes ellipsoidal altitude in the available GPS information values.\nThis feature was funded by NIWA\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: GPS Information Panel UX and Refactoring ¶ A substantial rework of the GPS information panel has been performed in order to simplify the user operation of GPS within QGIS and provide a more streamlined GPS experience.\nPreviously, all application-level GPS functionality was exposed through a single GPS \u0026quot;Information\u0026quot; panel interface, which included GPS connection settings, digitizing from GPS, and the actual display of GPS information. This interface became cluttered and difficult to use\nGPS functionality has now been split up into distinct parts:\nApplication level, rarely changed GPS settings are present in the GPS tab of the Options menu within QGIS Settings. A new floating \u0026quot;GPS Toolbar\u0026quot; has been added, which contains the most commonly used GPS-related operations. The final action in the GPS Toolbar opens a \u0026quot;GPS settings\u0026quot; popup, that contains various settings that are expected to be modified mid-session and are expected to be more readily accessible. The GPS information widget has been redesigned to show only GPS information. Specifically, only the \u0026quot;information\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;signal\u0026quot; tabs remain. The GPS information widget still contains a shortcut to the connect/disconnect action, and also a settings button that exposes the same GPS settings menu as is used in the GPS toolbar. The GPS information widget class is now responsible ONLY for showing the GPS information in the panel, and new dedicated classes have been created for handling digitizing from GPS, the new GPS toolbar, and GPS settings accordingly.\nThis feature was funded by NIWA\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Improved SLD Export Options ¶ A new extension of the Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) export API has been developed which exists in parallel with existing SLD export options, but provides additional functionality for the granular control of SLD exports.\nThis development includes the export of complex polygon layer styles as external graphic symbols which are stored alongside the exported SLD.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nRendering ¶ Feature: Global map terrain shading ¶ Users are now able to apply a global terrain shading effect to the map, which is based on the elevation of all the active layers that support elevation, including :\nRaster layers (if \u0026quot;Represent elevation Surface\u0026quot; is checked in the layer properties) Mesh layers Point cloud layers. The elevation value at any particular position for all the relevant layers are combined, and the considered elevation is chosen depending on one of two user defined methods:\nThe highest elevation is considered The elevation on the topmost layer in the layer tree is considered The implementation of shading methods are currently the Eye Dome Lighting and the hill-shade effect.\nElevation shading settings are exposed to the user interface in the following controls:\nIn project properties, in the same tab of the project elevation settings In the layer styling panel, a new tab has been created for defining global terrain shading settings This feature was funded by QGIS Community Crowdfunding Efforts\nThis feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec\nFeature: Add super and subscript support for text renderer ¶ Text items in QGIS now support superscript and subscript.\nThis allows for:\n\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;superscript\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; / \u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;subscript\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt; components in text, where the text will be vertically super or subscript aligned and automatically sized to 2/3rd of the parent font size. Users can also set a fixed font size for the super/subscript by including the relevant CSS rules in their HTML, e.g. \u0026lt;sup style=\u0026quot;font-size:33pt\u0026quot;\u0026gt;super\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; vertical-align: super or vertical-align: sub CSS formatting rules in any other HTML element This feature was funded by OSGEO UK\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Limit 2D extent of 3D scene ¶ The rendered extent of a 3D scene can now be constrained to features that intersect a user-specified 2D extent.\nThe manner in which rendered features are limited is dependent on the source data layer type:\nFlat, DEM, and Online Terrain are clipped at the specified extent Point cloud layers only load points within the specified extent Vector layers only load features that intersect the specified extent Extent-based feature filtering on mesh layers is still currently in development.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Community Crowdfunding Efforts\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis\nFeature: Improved camera control ¶ There are a couple of improvements that improve the user experience:\nElevation range is taken into account when \u0026quot;Zoom full\u0026quot; is used (users should not end up \u0026quot;behind\u0026quot; their scene anymore) Move camera vertically using Ctrl + Shift + Left mouse button Allow wheel zooming while moving the mouse Continue right mouse button zooming when pointer exits the viewport This feature was funded by QGIS Community Crowdfunding Efforts\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis (Lutra Consulting)\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Shortcuts manager in print layouts ¶ The shortcut manager, accessible from the settings menu of the primary QGIS interface, allows users to configure and override existing keyboard shortcuts and supports user defined methods for executing QGIS Actions.\nA similar keyboard manager configuration dialog has now been added to the Print Layout interface for enhanced productivity.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Use text renderer in layout legends ¶ This change allows the use of the full-text renderer capabilities for legend titles, subtitles, and item text.\nIt allows for the configuration of buffers, shadows, font spacing control, and other available options (including mixed HTML formatting) which are permitted for use in text formats.\nThis feature was funded by NIBIO\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Add feature_id() function ¶ A new feature_id($feature) expression function now allows for retrieving the feature ID of a feature object.\nThe function accepts one argument which must be a feature object. Accordingly, this function can be used with the results of any other function which returns feature objects, such as \u0026quot;get_feature\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;overlay_*\u0026quot;, etc.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New is_feature_valid() and is_attribute_valid() functions ¶ New is_feature_valid() and is_attribute_valid() functions are provided in QGIS expressions. Both functions validate a feature or attribute, based on the constraints attached to fields for a given vector layer. This enables users to leverage the select-by-expression utility to locate features that have unmet constraints. In addition, users can now use the rule-based renderer to provide visual feedback through symbology indicating the constraint validity state of rendered features.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Add x_at, y_at, z_at, m_at expression functions ¶ The available $functions are considered deprecated ($x_atand$y_at`), and instead of operating on the current feature geometry the functions instead support a feature geometry as arguments.\nThe changes for these expressions include the creation of similar functions for other geometry measurements. These new functions include:\nx_at(geometry, i) y_at(geometry, i) z_at(geometry, i) m_at(geometry, i) This feature was funded by Métropole Européenne de Lille\nThis feature was developed by Antoine Facchini\nData Management ¶ Feature: DateTime Field editing: segregation of display format and field value format ¶ Efforts to improve the management of datetime field information include the explicit definition of localization formatting for the display of datetime fields, whilst ensuring that the editing, capture, and storage of the field values conforms with international time formatting standards.\nThis feature was funded by 3liz\nThis feature was developed by rldhont\nFeature: Add option to directly log GPS points and tracks to a Geopackage or Spatialite db ¶ When activated in the GPS toolbar settings, the \u0026quot;Log to Geopackage/Spatialite\u0026quot; action will prompt the user to select an existing GPKG or SpatiaLite file, or enter a new file name. A \u0026quot;gps_points\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;gps_tracks\u0026quot; table will be created in the file with a predefined structure.\nAll incoming GPS messages will be logged to the gps_points layer, along with speed/bearing/altitude/accuracy information from the GPS.\nWhen the GPS is disconnected (or QGIS is closed), the entire recorded GPS track will be added to the gps_tracks table, along with some calculated information like track length, and start and end times)\nThis feature was funded by NIWA\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add an explicit \u0026quot;Offset from UTC\u0026quot; option for storing GPS feature timestamps ¶ This option allows users to manually enter a desired offset from UTC for storing GPS time stamps. This allows for full flexibility for users who need to account for daylight savings offsets or other complex time zone issues.\nThis feature was funded by NIWA\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Raster Attribute Tables (RAT) Support ¶ QGIS now includes extensive support for Raster Attribute Tables (RATs).\nThese updates provide a new RAT interface within the QGIS API, and support is provided for RATs managed by raster data providers (GDAL), as well as for generic value attribute table (VAT) files, provided that they are stored in an auxiliary DBF sidecar file.\nMuch of the functionality from the Python RAT Plugin was ported into QGIS to provide native support for RATs, and a new set of GUI operations affords users the following advanced functionalities:\nAutomatic raster styling: If a RAT is available when adding a raster to the project and includes style information, QGIS will apply the relevant styles to the raster layer by default. Automatic loading works for both embedded RATs and sidecar VAT.DBF with same basename of the raster. RAT reclassification: Reclassification of a raster can be performed by selecting a different column RAT Identify: Values from the RAT row corresponding to the relevant pixel value are shown in the identify Map Tool RAT properties: A new \u0026quot;Attribute Table\u0026quot; tab is available from the raster layers property window RAT editing: RATs offer basic editing capabilities RAT creation from current classification: RATs can be created from existing paletted or singleband pseudocolor styles A gallery of these functionalities in action is available on GitHub\nThis feature was funded by NOAA OCS Hydrography\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nMetadata and Metasearch ¶ Feature: Add key dates to layer and project metadata ¶ The following fields have been added to the QGIS layer/project metadata standard:\nDate created Date published Date revised Date superseded In previous releases, layer metadata had no date fields, whilst project metadata include only the created date field\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Audiovisual multimedia attribute attachments support ¶ New functionality introduces multimedia support for the external resources widget, allowing users to playback audio and video media files in the attachments viewer.\nThis change includes additional configuration options for external resources, with two new items in the integrated viewer type combo box. The video type will take into consideration the height set by the user. If it's left to auto, the video widget will grow to fill available space.\nThis functionality includes the development of the QgsMediaWidget object into the QGIS API for extended multimedia support.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Data defined editable state for form widgets ¶ The \u0026quot;Editable\u0026quot; checkbox status can now be controlled through an expression, the expression supports the \u0026quot;form\u0026quot; context, meaning that it can use current_value( '\u0026lt;field_name\u0026gt;' ) to dynamically change the editable status according to changes to other fields in the form.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Spacer widget for drag \u0026amp; drop attribute forms ¶ A new spacer widget is provided, with the option to draw a horizontal line, affording users a greater degree of control for how forms are rendered for end users and extending functionality for improved UX with thematic breaks and improved alignment.\nThe widget renders as a blank space in the form, which creates a manual separation between other form objects.\nWhen the \u0026quot;Draw line\u0026quot; option is set in the configuration it will fill the vacant space with a line in a manner similar to the horizontal rule, or \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; tag in html.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Dynamic text widgets with current_value support ¶ Text widgets now support dynamic configuration based on the values of fields present in the current form context by providing a current_value() function which may be evaluated within a QLabel object.\nUsing the current_value( '\u0026lt;field_name\u0026gt;' ) expression will evaluate and update the form when the form field value changes.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Dynamic HTML widgets with current_value support ¶ HTML widgets now support dynamic configuration based on the values of fields present in the current form context by providing a current_value function.\nUsing the current_value( '\u0026lt;field_name\u0026gt;' ) expression will evaluate and update the form when the form field value changes.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Multiple selections with filtering in value relation widget ¶ The Value Relation widget previously ignored \u0026quot;Use completer\u0026quot; option when \u0026quot;Allow multiple selections\u0026quot; was enabled. Now these two options work together and there is a search box present at the top of the table, allowing filtering of values. When \u0026quot;Use completer\u0026quot; option is not enabled, the search box is not shown as before.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Norway\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis (Lutra Consulting)\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: New layer ordering improvements ¶ New options for configurable layer tree insertion methods, and the automated sorting of layers added via drag and drop functions, are now available in QGIS.\nThe previous behavior was for QGIS to always load new layers above the currently active layer.\nNew options have been provided to allow for more control of how new layers are added to projects:\n(Always) On top of the layer tree Optimal index/position within the currently active layer's group The optimal index will attempt to intelligently order layers by type (e.g. points on top of areas etc.) and provide a significantly improved experience for new users.\nIn addition, drag and drop added layers will be added to the layer index tree at the location of the cursor when released to ensure the layer is rendered in a predictable and intuitive manner.\nThis feature was funded by Funded by the QGIS user group Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Additional options for XYZ Tile exports when using Leaflet html output ¶ Three new optional advanced parameters have been exposed for the XYZ Tile generation algorithm:\nLeaflet HTML output title Leaflet HTML output attribution Include OpenStreetMap basemap in Leaflet HTML output This feature was developed by Björn Hinkeldey\nFeature: Support data defined parameter values when using qgis_process tool ¶ While many processing algorithms supported data-defined parameter values, these were not possible to specify when using the qgis_process tool (or when representing algorithm settings as JSON and qgis_process commands), introducing limitations for utilizing QGIS within command line processing operations.\nA new syntax is now provided to allow the specification of data-defined parameter values when running qgis_process operations, and copying the algorithm settings from QGIS will now correctly handle data-defined values.\nCommand line arguments are specified with the expression: prefix within an encapsulated string, whilst the JSON definition is implemented using an expression object with a data_defined type definition. Note that special characters within the expression will need to use the appropriate escape characters relevant to the context in which they are used.\nConsidering the expression @variable*\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;*to_int('2')/100 for the following examples, the command-line syntax would be:\n--PARAMETER='expression:@variable*\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;*to_int('\\''2'\\'')/100' Whilst the JSON representation would be:\n\u0026quot;inputs\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;PARAMETER\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;expression\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;@variable*\\\u0026quot;field_name\\\u0026quot;*to_int('2')/100\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;data_defined\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;OUTPUT\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;TEMPORARY_OUTPUT\u0026quot; } This feature was funded by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest, Flemish Govt\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: New \u0026quot;load_layer\u0026quot; function ¶ A new load_layer expression function has been made available (exclusively for Processing expressions for the time being), which allows the loading of a map layer using a source string and provider name.\nIt is designed to allow the use of the expression functions which directly reference map layers (such as the aggregate functions) with a hardcoded layer path.\nThis permits the usage of these functions to be used outside of a project (such as via the qgis_process tool) and perform operations such as utilizing complex aggregate functions in the refactor fields algorithm via the qgis_process utility without creating a temporary project for data manipulation.\nThis feature was funded by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest, Flemish Govt\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add user interface for extent definition in GDAL Raster Calculator ¶ The GDAL Raster Calculator now includes an interface for user-specified extent definition, so that users no longer have to specify the --extent criteria in advanced options.\nThis feature was developed by Nicolas Godet\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Add option to store selected GPS component in geometry M values ¶ This new setting, available from the GPS settings panel, allows users to opt into creating geometries with M values from the inbuilt GPS logging tools. This applies to both features digitized from GPS logs, and from the new \u0026quot;Log to GeoPackage/SpatiaLite\u0026quot; functionality.\nOptions include the storing of timestamps (as milliseconds since epoch), ground speed, altitudes, bearings, and accuracy components as m values.\nThis feature was funded by NIWA\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Make GPS track destination layer an explicit user choice, remember in project ¶ In previous releases, the destination layer for newly created GPS digitized features always followed the current layer selection. This made it very tricky to design projects around GPS digitizing, as whenever a user started interacting with the project the captured GPS features would be placed unpredictably within the available layers.\nThe GPS feature destination layer is now an explicit choice made by the user. A user can set this layer, and then go ahead and interact with the rest of their project layers and be guaranteed that any time they hit the actions to create GPS features these features will be put into the correct layer. The destination layer is stored in the current project, so reopening a prior project will automatically restore the GPS destination layer (also making it easier for staff or scripts to create GPS digitizing projects in advance for other users and be confident that these will work correctly in the field).\nAdditional enhancements include:\nGPS destination layer is now made automatically editable when a feature is created, and the user is notified accordingly. This follows the approach we use for the interactive labeling tools and avoids user frustration where the features were previously not saved without any guidance as to why. The GPS toolbar actions now more intelligently follow the state of the project, GPS, and current GPS track, so that actions are only enabled when they make sense UI improvements and better tooltips This feature was funded by NIWA\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nProfile Plots ¶ Feature: New elevation profile canvas item for QGIS Quick ¶ A new elevation profile canvas item is available for QGIS Quick, allowing the elevation profile tools to be used in other cross platform and mobile QGIS applications.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Elevation profile plots in print layouts ¶ It is now possible to include profile plots in print layouts! There is a new \u0026quot;Add Elevation Profile\u0026quot; button in the toolbar which will initially create an empty plot. A plot can be initialized by clicking \u0026quot;Copy From Profile\u0026quot; button in the properties of the elevation profile item - this will use the active elevation profile from the main window of QGIS.\nThe elevation profile has wide configuration options - you can specify:\nwhat layers to include tolerance of the profile curve chart ranges (minimum and maximum distance/elevation) chart area borders and colors distance and elevation axes properties - intervals of labels, grid lines appearance, fonts and more This feature was funded by QGIS Community Crowdfunding Efforts\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Add dataset relationship editing and creation capabilities in browser ¶ This functionality allows for the creation of new embedded relationship definitions in database files for ESRI FileGeodatabases, GeoPackage, and sqlite databases.\nDeleting and modification of existing relationships is also supported, however the available functionality may depend on the constraints of the actual database format.\nThis feature was funded by Provincie Zuid-Holland\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Removal of Native GeoNode Provider ¶ The Native GeoNode Provider has been removed from QGIS and is now instead available as a plugin.\nThis change is due to the extension of plugin APIs to support the necessary functionalities, such as the data source manager, and was executed in line with QEP 262.\nThis feature was developed by Giovanni Allegri\nFeature: In data source manager, allow users to directly add an XYZ tile layer without having to create a connection first ¶ Users may now directly add an XYZ tile layer in the data source manager, without having to first create a new connection.\nThis permits users to easily add ad-hoc XYZ layers to their map without polluting their lists of saved connections.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: SQL Logging for OGR Provider ¶ As GDAL now supports query logging callbacks for SQLite-based layers, QGIS leverages this functionality to allow for query logging in the QGIS debug tools.\nThis is available for OGR-based SQLite data sources (SpatiaLite/ GPKG).\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: S3 Cloud Storage Support ¶ S3 compatible cloud storage, such as AWS S3 and MinIO, are now supported as a method for accessing and storing external files, made available by using the external storage UI for cloud storage of attachments.\nA new QGIS Auth method named \u0026quot;AWS S3\u0026quot; has been provided to support connecting to services using the S3 protocol.\nThis feature was funded by Métropole Grand Lyon**\nThis feature was developed by Jacky Volpes\nFeature: Resolution aware WMTS layers with automatic upscaling ¶ QGIS now allows for WMTS layers to take device screen resolution, or dots per inch (DPI), into account and scale up the tile resolution on high DPI screens.\nA new combo box has been added in the new WMS and WMTS server dialog for configuration of the WMTS tile pixel ratio. This allows QGIS to automatically handle the scaling up and down of tiles retrieved from the service based on the rendered DPI.\nNote that enabling smooth pixmap transform is recommended when automatic upscaling is active\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Drop unmaintained SAGA provider from QGIS installations ¶ This provider has not been maintained and does not work with newer SAGA versions. Users are encouraged to use the 3rd-party \u0026quot;Processing Saga NextGen\u0026quot; plugin instead.\nAfter many many years of discussion, it's time for the inbuilt provider to go!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Improve support of layers with unknown geometry type for WFS provider ¶ The QGIS WFS provider has been improved to look in the response to the GetCapabilities request (if using WFS 2.0) if the IsPoint, IsCurve, IsSurface extended filter functions are present.\nWhen such a layer is added to the project, a \u0026quot;Select Items to Add\u0026quot; dialog box is displayed.\nThis enables the user to select one or several layers among ones of NoGeometry, MultiPoint, MultiCurve, MultiSurface, GeometryCollection types.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS-DE user group\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: QGIS_APPLICATION_FULL_NAME environment variable ¶ This change defines the QgsApplication::applicationFullName() method for use with PostgreSQL application_name and QGIS Server Logging.\nFor QGIS Server, the QGIS_SERVER_APPLICATION_NAME can be specified instead and will take precedence over the QGIS_APPLICATION_FULL_NAME setting.\nThe value may also be specified in the /qgis/application_full_name variable in the QGIS Server config file.\nBy default, this value will be defined by the value of QgsApplication::applicationName()+' '+QgsApplication::platform().\nThis feature was funded by 3liz\nThis feature was developed by rldhont\nFeature: GeoJSON support for WFS DescribeFeatureType ¶ JSON support has been added as an output format for DescribeFeatureType requests to the QGIS Server WFS. Although not an explicit stipulation by the WFS specifications, this functionality allows for responses that match other WFS service providers such as GeoServer.\nThis feature was funded by Kristianstads kommun\nThis feature was developed by David Marteau\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Topology checker rules enabling/disabling and filtering ¶ The topology checker plugin has been improved to provide functionality for better management of rules, as well as filtering on large error sets. Additional enhancements bring the UX more in line with later QGIS releases and allow productivity enhancement such as bulk deletions and rule disablement.\nThe topology checker rules dialog now features check boxes which are attached to individual rules, which allow for enabling/ disabling rules when running validity checks without having to remove them. This avoids scenarios when users don't want to lose rules but are only interested in validating a subset.\nThe topology checker panel also has a a new combo box below its toolbar to allow for quick filtering of errors to allow users to focus on a specific error type, although it will continue to display all error types by default.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: QgsExifTools Improvements ¶ New functionality has been added to the QgsExifTools class, including:\nThe readTag() and readTags() functions now support Xmp metadata tags A new tagImage() function can be used to add individual metadata tags to a given image, which can be used in addition to the pre-existing geoTagImage() function This feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Smart bracket autocomplete updates for Code Editors ¶ Previous releases of QGIS included an autoCloseBracket setting for the Python Console, which had a number of limitations in its behavior, including being limited to use within the Python Console and Script Editor interfaces.\nUpdates to the autocomplete settings extend this functionality to other Code Editor interfaces, such as the Expression Editor, Project Macro Editor, and Script Editor. The autoCloseBracket behavior has also been adjusted to better mimic the behavior of modern IDEs, and an autoSurround setting has been added to surround selected text when using the following character sets:\nbraces/ curly brackets: {} square/ box brackets: [] parenthesis/ round brackets: () double quotation mark: \u0026quot; single quotation mark: ' backticks: ``` asterisk: * With the exception of the backtick and asterisk characters, the autoCloseBracket functionality is available when encapsulating new data without an active text selection.\nThe autocompletion configuration is enabled by default for new releases, but a new settings interface is provided for granular control by users.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Add \u0026quot;toggle comment\u0026quot; action to the integrated python console ¶ The comment and uncomment actions of the embedded Python Editor have been replaced with a toggle comment action, which is now also available in the Processing Script Editor.\nThis brings the editor UX in line with other IDEs such as VSCode, which allow the ability to toggle comments.\nThe default shortcut for this action is set to Ctrl+:\nThe toggle comment action is also available in Project Macro and Expression Editors, however this is only available using the Ctrl+: shortcut and does not include the action button on the UI.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Even Rouault ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.28 backport commit (GitHub) Task: take into account GDT_Int8 #50907 PR #51586 PR #51602 Task: take into account GDT_Int8 #50907 PR #51587 N/A MultiLineString from OpenFileGDB Disappears on Zoom #32534 GDAL PR 7137 DATETIME: Wrong timezone for UTC in attribute table #48393 PR #51625 PR #51645 distutils is deprecated but still used #51532 PR #51630 PR #51644 Importing Data into a QGIS Created File Based Geodatabase #51435 https://github.com/nyalldawson/QGIS/pull/36 N/A Importing Data into a QGIS Created File Based Geodatabase #51435 GDAL PR 7147 GDAL PR 7176 OGCAPI Features url of collection with dot #51663 PR #51671 PR #51987 CityGML Import not working with LoD2 files #51647 GDAL PR 7168 N/A Broken layers when creating new table on GPKG created by third party #51721 GDAL PR 7174 N/A \u0026quot;Save Layer Edits\u0026quot; after \u0026quot;Add Polygon Feature\u0026quot; deletes added polygons when the objects have no attributes #51247 GDAL PR 7184 GDAL PR 7188 gis transforming coordinates incorrectly #51792 proj PR 3621 N/A Some versions of QGIS can't parse mixed-dtype-columns in GeoJSON #51911 None: just investigation \u0026amp; preliminary fix attempt This feature was funded by QGIS.ORG (through donations and sustaining memberships)\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nFeature: Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.28 backport commit (GitHub) Add Row does not work with postgres identity columns that have many characters #51563 PR #51641 PR #52059 If some layers are not identifyable, QGIS Server WMS \u0026quot;GetFeatureInfo\u0026quot; returns LayerNotQueryable #51613 PR #51646 (tests only, cannot reproduce) N/A Research and diagnosys on: Bug or new behaviour on default fields values on QGIS 3.28.X #51543 Asked feedback to the original developer of the \u0026quot;feature\u0026quot; [ogr provider] Saving big CSV edit is very slow when the whole file has to be updated (such as adding a new field) #51668 PR #51686 PR #51700 Vector data - Graduated Symbology - Legend Format - Only use upper limit #51691 PR #51692 PR #51696 Weird interval QgsDoubleSpinbox behavior in graduated symbology with fixed interval #51687 PR #51714 No Project predefined scales are trimmed at thousand separator after project restart/reopening properties #51735 PR #51749 PR #51766 wms getLegendGraphic call the group and not the layer when many style layers add from browser #51759 PR #51765 No overlay_intersects' does not work with WFS-layer #51492 PR #51773 PR #51793 multiedit in attribute table not working properly in version \u0026gt;=3.22 #48077 PR #51801 Risky?

button behavior are provided to configure aspects such as separator, or including header information.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Disable map tips for a specific layer ¶ A new feature in the layer properties allows for disabling mapTips on a specific layer.\nOn the QGIS API, a mapTipsEnabled Q_PROPERTY was added to the QgsMapLayer class to enable this functionality.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Show value relation description when hovering the combobox ¶ A description tooltip is now available when hovering the cursor over the value in the relation editor widget's combobox.\nThe description tooltip matches that of the currently selected item's description as defined in the 'description column' on the value relation configuration panel.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: 2d map canvas view docking actions ¶ The action to dock and undock 2d map canvas views has been added to match the behaviour of 3d canvas views.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add clear recently used crs button ¶ The ability to remove \u0026quot;recently used\u0026quot; CRS information has been implemented in various ways, including:\nPressing the Del key while the list of recently used crs has focus remove the selected CRS A column in the recent crs table with a button to clear individual CRS A clear selected context menu action A clear all recent CRS context menu action that will prompt the user for confirmation This feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Reverse wheel zoom ¶ A setting is now available to reverse the zoom direction of the mouse wheel (scrolling forward zooms out)\nThis setting will affects wheel zooms in multiple contexts, including:\nin the map canvas (QgsMapCanvas) in the map overview (QgsMapOverviewCanvas) in the layout view (QgsLayoutView) in the layout map items when the \u0026quot;move item content\u0026quot; tool is active (QgsLayoutViewToolMoveItemContent) in the Elevation profile canvas (QgsElevationProfileCanvas) In the model editor graphic view (QgsModelGraphicsView) This feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Spatial bookmarks rotation ¶ Map rotation can now be stored and applied in Spatial bookmarks, which includes a new context menu in the Spatial Bookmark Manager Panel.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nAnnotations ¶ Feature: Annotation tool improvements ¶ A number of improvements have been made to the behavior of annotation tools including:\nPreventing the resizing of an annotation when the cursor is not actually over the frame Add a context menu (when an annotation tool is activated) on annotation items Drop the undocumented toggleTextItemVisibilities (toggled Text annotations visibility with Ctrl+T) Improve the selection and resizing behavior, including improvements for handling overlapping annotations This feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Annotation live preview ¶ A \u0026quot;live update\u0026quot; checkbox in the annotation editors allows for on the fly review of rendered annotation content.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Improved 3d measure tool ¶ The following improvements have been implemented to the measuring tool in 3d scenes:\nAllows measuring on point cloud points Display billboard circle markers on the 3d rubber band's vertices Moving the mouse moves the rubber band's last vertex (although the measured results are not updated until user clicks) Moving the camera does not remove current measurements Allows using backspace and del keys to undo (remove last measurement) Allows using Esc to clear measurements, matching the behavior of its 2d counterpart Renders 3d rubberbands on top of other 3d entities so they don't get occluded The object selection logic has also been refactored for more control, and the 3d identify tool was also enhanced to prevent interference with camera navigation as well as a bug fix for where the wrong FIDs were returned on specific cases.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis\nPoint Clouds ¶ Feature: Native point cloud Processing provider ¶ A new native processing provider has been provided for point cloud algorithms, in line with QEP 263.\nUnder the hood provider utilizes the pdal_wrench command line tool and currently supports the following algorithms:\nInformation: outputs a basic metadata of the point cloud (number of points, extent, crs, etc) Convert format: convert point cloud to a different format, e.g. las to laz Reproject: reproject point cloud to a different CRS Fix projection: fix (assign) CRS of a point cloud file Clip: clip point cloud by clipping polygon(s) Merge: merge multiple point clouds in a single file Tile: create tiles from input data Thin: create a thinned version of the point cloud Boundary: export vector layer containing point cloud boundaries Density: export a raster file where each cell contains number of points that are in that cell's area Export to raster: export point cloud data to a 2D raster grid Export to vector: export point cloud data to a vector layer with 3D points Export to raster (TIN): export point cloud data to a 2D raster grid using a triangulation of points Filer: extract subset from the point cloud using PDAL expressions As pdal_wrench requires PDAL \u0026gt;= 2.5.0, the new processing provider will be available only where the PDAL version requirement is satisfied.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Point cloud expression builder for Processing framework ¶ A new point cloud expression builder widget is available within the GUI to create filters for point clouds in a user friendly manner consistent with the existing QGIS Expression Builder interfaces.\nWithin the QGIS API, the QgsProcessingParameterExpression parameter has been extended with the types Qgis and PointCloud. If parameter has a PointCloud type, it will use the point cloud expression builder widget. To maintain backward compatibility, by default an expression parameter will use the Qgis expression type.\nThe QgsPointCloudExpression class was also extended with a new method to convert QGIS point cloud expressions to PDAL expressions.\nExisting PDAL algorithms using expression filters have been updated to use expression parameters instead of strings.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Add filtering by rectangle and expression to PDAL algorithms ¶ Added the option to filter input point cloud by rectangle (extent) and expression in the following PDAL algorithms:\nboundary clip density export to raster (normal and TIN variants) export to vector merge thin This allows the processing of only a subset of points from the input file(s), without the need to performing an intermediate filtering step or generating temporary files.\nFor these who need only filtering there is also a separate Filter algorithm capable of filtering either by extent, by expression or by their combination.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: New parameter type for point cloud attribute ¶ Useful for point cloud algorithms involving attributes, like exporting specific attribute values as raster or filtering point clouds.\nThis also deprecates parameterAsFields API call, and parameterAsStrings should be used both for fields and point cloud attributes instead.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Display virtual point clouds (VPC) in 3D views ¶ Virtual point clouds can be rendered within 3d views. For performance management, a sub index threshold is specified so that the view will render the chunked entity of the point cloud only when appropriate and will instead render the bounding region of a particular sub index when the threshold criteria is not met.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis\nFeature: Virtual point clouds (VPC) ¶ A new data provider is available for Virtual Point Cloud (VPC) files created by the pdal_wrench utility and the Build virtual point cloud (VPC) tool in the newly introduced Native point cloud Processing provider.\nThe VPC file is handled as a single layer in QGIS and may contain a large number of point cloud files whose indexes are lazy loaded when the canvas is zoomed in enough. An extent renderer is used for the individual indexes while their extent fits the canvas' width and the user defined renderer is only used when zoomed in further.\nA Virtual Point Cloud is a JSON container file with a .vpc extension, referring to other files/URLs that contain the actual point cloud data. This is a concept similar to virtual rasters (VRTs) in GDAL. The JSON content is actually a STAC API ItemCollection. See VPC specification for more details.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Hyperlink support for HTML-enabled label exports ¶ QGIS labels which contain HTML content will now support embedding functional hyperlinks in relevant layouts exports, such as PDFs.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Schaffhausen\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Support filtering layout legends by multiple linked map items ¶ Instead of limiting layout legend filtering to a single linked map, this change permits legends to be filtered instead by multiple linked maps. It is designed to accommodate the use case where a layout has multiple maps, potentially at different scales and showing different extents, and a single legend is required which includes all symbols visible across all the maps.\nThe UX has been designed to avoid changing the current user workflows, in that legends will still be linked to a single main map item. This map is used when determining the scale (and other map dependent properties) at which to render the legend's symbols. Checking the \u0026quot;Only show items inside linked maps\u0026quot; option will still automatically filter the legend by the content of the main linked maps. However, there's a new \u0026quot;...\u0026quot; options button next to the \u0026quot;Only show items inside linked maps\u0026quot; checkbox which allows users to select also other maps from their layout to consider when determining visible items:\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Add ltrim/rtrim functions ¶ Allows trimming spaces or other characters from just the start or end of strings\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Field value list in merge feature dialog ¶ When merging features, users may now select from a list of available values from the selected features, rather than manually capturing a manual value for a field.\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Common angle option extensions for advanced digitizing ¶ The advanced digitizing options for common angles have been extended with the following functionalities:\nNew common angles for 0.1°, 0.5°, and 1.0° A new option has been added to show current common angle in the floater context widget New 'N' 'SHIFT+N' keyboard shortcuts are available to cycle through the common angle options This feature was funded by ChartWorld International\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Floater settings and bearing information for advanced digitizing ¶ A new configuration setting for the advanced digitizing tool allows users to toggle the display of the \u0026quot;floater\u0026quot; contextual menu which follows the cursor during digitizing. Additional options are included for adding information to the floater panel, such as the display of bearing and azimuth information.\nThis feature was funded by ChartWorld International\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nAttribute table ¶ Feature: Improve loading time of attribute tables with hidden fields ¶ Improve attribute table loading time when there are hidden virtual fields and (in a more limited way) when there are hidden non-virtual fields.\nThis feature was funded by QTIBIA Engineering and QCooperative.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nData Management ¶ Feature: Allow a range of cells to be copied from SQL results window ¶ Allows selection of a range of cells to copy to clipboard. Results are copied as both plain text and html, so can be pasted easily into spreadsheet apps/etc as tables\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Modified New field dialog behavior and alias support ¶ When creating new fields, the 'Comment' option is now only exposed for datasources which support editing comments (preventing QGIS from silently discarding the information).\nThis also adds support for setting field aliases within the new field dialog, and extends field comments and aliases for supported OGR formats.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add DistanceUnit value for inches ¶ Inches are now included as valid map units within QGIS.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Record split policy selection in form dialog ¶ A new \u0026quot;field split policy\u0026quot; choice item is exposed in the layer properties form dialog. That allows users to easily determine the current policy for splitting a field and change as required.\nThe following policies have been provided:\nduplicate values remove values use default value use ratio of geometries This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Add control over horizontal / vertical stretch for attribute form widgets ¶ This functionality exposes two new \u0026quot;size\u0026quot; options for edit form widgets, allowing control over the horizontal and vertical stretch factors for the widget. By setting a horizontal or vertical stretch, users can control how edit widgets will relatively resize when resizing an attribute form.\nFor example, a user can set a higher horizontal stretch value for widgets which should \u0026quot;grab\u0026quot; more of the available horizontal space, such as for those widgets which are expected to have longer values. Similarly, the vertical stretch setting (available for select widget types) will control how widgets grow vertically when resizing forms, relative to the form dialog.\nTogether these options give more control to users over the exact layout and sizing of their attribute forms.\nBy default, the stretch values are set to \u0026quot;Default\u0026quot; which is the same as the behavior exhibited in previous versions of QGIS.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add new attribute form container type \u0026quot;Row\u0026quot; ¶ This container always lays out child widgets in a horizontal row, where the number of columns is automatically determined by the number of child widgets.\nIt's useful for creation of compact forms, where no space will be wasted by assigning extraneous horizontal width to widgets where the expected values will always be short.\nEg: creating 3 rows with 3, 2, 1 child widgets respectively results in the layout:\nAttr 1: [...] Attr 2: [...] Attr 3: [...] Attr 4: [..........] Attr 5: [..........] Attr 6: [...............................] Without the option of row containers then the all horizontal rows will have the same number of columns, eg:\nAttr 1: [...] Attr 2: [...] Attr 3: [...] Attr 4: [...] Attr 5: [...] Attr 6: [...] (leaving insufficient horizontal length for attributes 4-6), or\nAttr 1: [..........] Attr 2: [..........] Attr 2: [..........] Attr 3: [..........] Attr 4: [..........] Attr 5: [..........] Attr 6: [..........] (resulting in wasted horizontal space next to attribute 6, and an extra row taking up vertical space)\nThis feature was funded by NIWA\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Download vector tiles algorithm ¶ A new Processing algorithm has been added which enables the downloading of vector tiles from a remote server. This functionality includes vector tile support for the map layer parameter, as well as a new vector tile destination parameter for Processing algorithms. The output MBTiles format files can also be automatically added to the canvas after processing.\nThis feature was funded by Mergin Maps\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Allow configuration of the order of outputs created by a model ¶ A new \u0026quot;Reorder Output Layers\u0026quot; action to the model designer menu has been added which allows model creators to set a specific order which the outputs from their model must use when loading the results into a project. This gives the model creator a means of ensuring that layers are logically ordered on the canvas when running a model, such as placing a vector layer output over a raster layer output, or a point layer over a polygon layer.\nThe model creator can also set an optional \u0026quot;Group name\u0026quot; for the outputs for automatically grouping outputs within the layer tree using a new group name or by adding them to an existing group.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS User Group Germany\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Algorithm to create COPC files for input point clouds ¶ A new algorithm adds the \u0026quot;Create COPC\u0026quot; option to the PDAL provider for generating Cloud Optimized Point Clouds. The algorithm creates a COPC file for each input point cloud file and can be useful for indexing files before using them in QGIS, or when building a VPC.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Add invert selection tool on refactor fields processing tool ¶ A new button has been added to the field management interface of the refactor fields processing tool button which allows users to invert the selection. This allows for more efficient management of fields such as enabling bulk field deletes.\nThis feature was added during the QGIS Contributor Meeting 2023, s-hertogenbosch\nThis feature was funded by camptocamp\nThis feature was developed by Ismail Sunni\nFeature: Support field comments and aliases in processing algorithms ¶ This adds support for handling field comments and aliases in the processing \u0026quot;add field to attributes table\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;refactor fields\u0026quot; algorithms. Additionally, it ensures that field comments and aliases are copied from source layers to destination layers when present.\nIf the output layers do not support comments/ aliases then user-friendly warnings are shown in the processing log advising users of the limitation.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Build virtual point cloud (VPC) algorithm ¶ The new algorithm allows user to build virtual point cloud (VPC) files that reference multiple existing point cloud datasets. This allows then visualization and processing of many point cloud files as a single layer in QGIS.\nAdditional options are available for the \u0026quot;Build VPC\u0026quot; Processing algorithm, which provide the following utilities for building Virtual Point Clouds:\ncalculate statistics from input data calculate exact boundaries from input data build an overview point cloud This feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Thread management in algorithm settings ¶ A handy new environment configuration setting has been created for the configuration of the number of threads an algorithm should use when an algorithm is capable of using several cores, such as TauDEM or PDAL.\nThis functionality has been applied to the PDAL and TileXYZ algorithms.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Allow temporary folder to be temporarily changed through the algorithm settings panel ¶ Individual processing algorithms may now include an environment setting to specify a custom temporary folder which overwrites the configured temporary file path. This is useful in situations where a particular tool may use a lot of temporary disk space and a dedicated location or scratch disk is required, or when a particular operation requires performance enhancements offered by a particular disk or path.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow processing dialog to override default processing context settings ¶ A new \u0026quot;Algorithm Settings\u0026quot; action has been added to the Advanced button of the processing algorithms interface. Selecting it shows a panel which allows users to control general processing settings which apply to a particular instance of the algorithm execution. It's intended to be a place where a user can override their global processing settings on an ad-hoc basis without having to change their usual default settings.\nIncludes settings for:\ninvalid geometry handling (Unlike the existing per-parameter setting override for this, setting the handling method here will apply to ALL inputs for the algorithm) distance unit and area units to use for distance/area measurements This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Additional parameters for gdal2xyz algorithm ¶ The gdal2xyz processing algorithm from the GDAL processing provider now includes parameters for skipnodata and src, and dstnodata.\nThis feature was developed by Luke Pinner\nFeature: Add \u0026quot;Keep disjoint results separate\u0026quot; option to buffer algorithm ¶ If checked, then any disjoint parts in the buffer results will be output as separate single-part features. This setting is designed to expose a similar functionality as is available for the 'dissolve' algorithm.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Allow filter expressions to be set for vector sources ¶ This change adds a new \u0026quot;feature filter\u0026quot; option alongside the existing feature limit and invalid geometry handling options available for all vector inputs to processing layers.\nIt allows users to enter an expression to subset the layer dynamically when running the tool, avoiding the need for separate steps to set layer filters or create layer subsets.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Support *.HEIC format images in Processing \u0026quot;Import Photos\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ The Import Photos algorithm now allows importing *.heic images with GDAL's HEIF image support.\nThis feature was developed by Chris Shucksmith\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Settings editor updates ¶ The interface for settings editors have seen a major overhaul and the advanced settings interface has the following user facing changes:\nA choice of using the old or the new settings widget, which is remembered A \u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot; setting allows to bypass the warning before showing the settings tree Settings have dedicated editors (spin box, checkbox, colorbutton, etc.) The modification of settings is now only executed when apply is pressed Current settings are displayed in italic, whereas settings to which changes will be applied are displayed in red In addition, the settings API has undergone significant changes including:\nRemoval of the QgsSettingsEntryByValue class, using the by reference only The old QgsSettingsTreeWidget has been renamed to QgsSettingsTreeWidgetOld (in app) New API classes introduced include:\nQgsSettingsTreeWidget and QgsSettingsTreeModel: tree widget + model to show and edit the settings QgsSettingsEditorWidgetWrapper (pure virtual): a base wrapper class to create and handle a setting editor widget QgsSettingsEditorWidgetWrapperTemplate (pure virtual): the base class for the wrapper of settings declared in C++ API (using typed methods) Classes for settings editors: QgsSettingsStringEditorWidgetWrapper, etc. QgsSettingsEditorWidgetRegistry: a registry of the setting editor wrappers This feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: User profile selector ¶ In previous versions of QGIS, when QGIS Desktop was closed the current profile would be saved in the profiles.ini configuration file, so the default profile was the profile used in the last instance of QGIS that was closed.\nA new User selection policy feature allows users to select how default profiles are defined, in accordance with the following three options:\nLast Profile: The legacy mode which follows previous version behavior. This uses the last closed profile when opening a new instance of QGIS. Default Profile: Manually define a default profile among the existing profile that will always be used by default (without using a command line flag or electing a profile from within the QGIS UI) Let user choose at startup When \u0026quot;Let user choose\u0026quot; is selected, if there are 2 or more profiles, a selection dialog is displayed before the SplashScreen which will allow the user to choose which profile to use or to create a new profile which will be loaded automatically.\nRegardless of the selected policy, if only one profile exists it will be used, and if no profile exist, the default profile will be created and used.\nUser profile icons are also provided to allow users to visually differentiate between their active profiles.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nProfile Plots ¶ Feature: Distance unit selection for elevation profiles ¶ Users may now choose from a selection of distance units to override the default (Canvas CRS map units) for elevation profiles in both the interactive elevation profiles (via the settings toolbar button) and for layout elevation profiles.\nIn layout profiles, there is an additional option which controls where the distance unit suffixes should be placed. The following options are available to manage the display of unit suffixes:\nhide the suffixes display for all values display for the first value display for the last value display for both the first and last values. Note that it is currently not possible to expose unit selection for the vertical axis, as this is currently dimensionless and will require the development of vertical CRS handling in QGIS as outlined in QEP 267.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Export elevation profiles ¶ A new item has been added to the elevation profile toolbar, which includes various options for exporting elevation profiles.\nProfile plots can now be exported as:\n3D Features: exports the profile line as 3d cross sections, with z values taken from the elevation slices 2D Profile: exports the profile as a distance vs elevation chart (i.e. as shown in the elevation profile widget) Distance/Elevation Table: exports sample distance vs elevation values as a table The results can be saved as DXF files, CSV files, or any of the standard writable vector spatial formats shapefile geopackages.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add layers to elevation profiles ¶ An explicit \u0026quot;Add Layers\u0026quot; button has been added to the elevation profile dock. This provides a user-friendly why of adding new layers to a plot - clicking it will show a filtered list of possible layers which can be added to the plot, but which currently aren't in the plot (i.e it will include all raster layers from the project which aren't marked as having elevation data). Selecting layers will cause them to automatically be marked as having elevation data and immediately added to the plot. Layers can now be added to elevation plots via drag and drop from the layer tree. Unfortunately, users will have to explicitly hold the \u0026quot;Ctrl\u0026quot; key while dragging in order to force the copy action due to upstream library limitations. This feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add \u0026quot;Fill Above\u0026quot; mode for elevation profile drawing ¶ The new fill above drawing mode for profile plots also includes additional options to limit the extent of \u0026quot;fill above\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;fill below\u0026quot; elevation ranges for a layer.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add option to lock the horizontal/ vertical scale to matching scales ¶ When activated, this option ensures that the horizontal and vertical scales are always kept equal. For instance, a 45 degree slope will always appear as a 45 degree slope in the profile.\nThis feature was funded by Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nSensors ¶ Feature: Core sensors framework ¶ A core sensors framework provides a sensor types registry, a sensor manager, and three simple QIODevice-based sensor types as follows:\nTCP socket UDP socket Serial port A sensor manager is attached to project instances that allows users to register sensors within their project files. Contrary to other inputs such as a positioning device, sensors are considered to be much more project-specific data inputs. The big advantage of project-based sensors is that it makes those much more portable and easier to share across users.\nA new sensor_data() function is added to the project scope which is available using expressions, that returns the latest captured sensor data values for a specific sensor name. An optional expiration (in milliseconds) parameter allows for expressions that will reject a specific sensor value is older that the provided expiration value.\nThis feature was funded by Sevenson Environmental Services\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Sensors GUI registry and configuration widgets ¶ Configuration widgets are provided for the TCP, UDP, and serial port sensor types which will allow users to configure, add, and remove sensors within the project properties dialog's sensors panel.\nThe implementation includes a sensor GUI registry to easily allow for additional python sensors to be created and shipped as plugins.\nThis feature was funded by Sevenson Environmental Services\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Sensor options panel within the project properties dialog ¶ A sensor table widget is provided that displays registered sensors within a project, along with with actions to connect and disconnect from sensors. The table is accessible via a new sensors panel in the project properties dialog.\nThis feature was funded by Sevenson Environmental Services\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Set field comments in browser ¶ When supported by providers, a new browser context menu action for fields allows for users to set/change the field's comments in the datasource.\nCurrently supported for OGR formats with field comment capabilities such as GPKG, ESRI File Geodatabase, NetCDF, or Geoparquet, as well as PostgreSQL data sources.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Set field aliases in browser ¶ When supported by providers, a new browser context menu action for fields allows for users to set/change the field's alias in the datasource.\nCurrently supported for OGR formats with field comment capabilities such as GPKG, ESRI File Geodatabase, NetCDF, or Geoparquet.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Load layers in parallel threads when opening project ¶ QGIS will now load supported layers in parallel when loading a project, significantly improving project load times in certain instances such as when a project includes numerous remote layers.\nTo load a layer on a parallel worker thread, the layer data provider must support parallel loading (currently GDAL and PostgreSQL providers).\nA new advanced setting is available to deactivate this behavior when necessary.\nThis feature was funded by KoBold Metals\nThis feature was developed by Vincent Cloarec\nFeature: Implements server-side filtering using Part 1 or Part 3 ¶ The WFS/ OGC API for Features (OAPIF) data provider has been extended to support enhanced filtering criteria in line with open standards.\nNew functionalities include:\nSupport for filtering on feature properties (OGC API Features Part 1 - /rec/core/fc-filters). This uses the /api endpoint to get the list of queryable items. Support for filtering based on OGC API Features Part 3 - CQL2-text Pass selected CRS to query builder UI Implement a getFeature() expression translation For the CQL2text compatibility, the server /conformance implementation is required to declare at least the following data:\nhttp://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-3/1.0/conf/filter http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-3/1.0/conf/features-filter http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/cql2-text http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/basic-cql2 The /collections/{collid}/queryables endpoint is requested to get the queryable properties.\nAdditional conformance classes for advanced filtering include the following items:\nhttp://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/advanced-comparison-operators: for IN, BETWEEN, LIKE http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/case-insensitive-comparison: for ILIKE http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/basic-spatial-operators: for intersects(geomcolumn, geomFromWkt('POINT(x y)')) and bbox_intersects(geomcolumn, geomFromWkt('WKT LITERAL')) This feature was developed by Even Rouault\nFeature: Expose option to load vector tile sources from files in Data Source Manager ¶ The Vector Tile tab now includes choices for selecting from a \u0026quot;Service\u0026quot; (the existing, connection based approach for adding vector tiles from online sources) or \u0026quot;File\u0026quot; (a new option which allows directly adding a data source using VTPK or MBTiles vector tile files).\nThis feature was funded by Landesamt für Vermessung und Geoinformation, Feldkirch, Austria\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Additional user controlled vector tile properties ¶ Vector tile data sources now support user defined controls for layer opacity and blending modes.\nAdditionally, it adds the standard \u0026quot;Source\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Rendering\u0026quot; tabs to the vector tile layer properties dialog. The Rendering tab contains the layer's scale based visibility (just like for other layer types), and the source tab contains the layer name, crs override and provider-specific source controls.\nSource widgets are also for the VTPK and MBTiles vector tile providers, allowing control over the source vtpk/mbtiles file path.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Fix broken layer support for vtpk/mbtile vector tile layers, show vtpk files in browser ¶ Vector tile layers now expose all the required API items for supporting broken layer handling and discovery, making their behavior consistent with other layer types. Additionally, by implementing the modern provider metadata APIs for the VTPK provider we ensure that VTPK files are shown in the browser panel for easy discovery.\nThis feature was funded by Landesamt für Vermessung und Geoinformation, Feldkirch, Austria\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: PDF format options for WMS GetPrint ¶ The FORMAT_OPTIONS parameter in QGIS Server can now also be used to pass format options for PDF format to WMS GetPrint. This allows more control in GetPrint requests when generating GeoPDF outputs, such as Georeference or Geometry Simplification settings.\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nFeature: Configurable capabilities cache size ¶ The QGIS Server GetCapabilities request cache size can now be configured with the QGIS_SERVER_CAPABILITIES_CACHE_SIZE parameter, which uses an integer input specifying the number of requests to cache. A notice of \u0026quot;Removed cached WMS capabilities document\u0026quot; will be logged when all slots are taken and a cached document is dropped.\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer\nFeature: Add display name in GetFeatureInfo response ¶ A new WITH_DISPLAY_NAME parameter will add the display name in the GetFeatureInfo response if needed, similar to the existing WITH_MAPTIP parameter.\nThis feature was funded by 3liz.com\nThis feature was developed by Étienne Trimaille\nFeature: OGC API - Features: Add full pagination for collection items HTML page ¶ To make browsing the features more user friendly and provide more information, the following was implemented and added to the HTML template:\nfull pagination which shows always the total number of pages configurable pagesize via dropdown number of matching items number of returned items pagesize/pagination controls also at the bottom of the page This feature was developed by Björn Hinkeldey\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Python console help improvements ¶ A special ? command has been added to the python console which displays a useful help message, identifies some key variables, and provides helper functions for improving the developer experience within QGIS Desktop.\nThe _pyqgis and _api helper functions will take a parameter (an instance or class), and will display the matching object page from the QGIS or Qt documentation.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Run shell commands from the Python Console ¶ The QGIS Python ConsoleMimics IPython behavior to run system commands.\nRun any command that works at the command-line with the syntax !\u0026lt;cmd\u0026gt;. The console will start a subprocess, and forward its output to the Python Console Output. While the subprocess is running, the Python Console Input switch to STDIN mode and forwards entered character to the child process. This make it possible to send confirmation when the child program ask for it. This provides easy access to commands such as pip for the simple installation and removal of dependencies directly within the QGIS project context When the Console is in STDIN mode, pressing Ctrl+C will kill the subprocess. Affect the result of a command to a variable with the syntax var = !cmd This feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Reformat code action for code editors ¶ A \u0026quot;format code\u0026quot; action has been added to the Python Console Editor which allows for the automated linting/ pretty printing of code in line with the capabilities of modern code editors.\nAdditional configuration settings for this action include:\nFormat on save: if enabled, formatting is applied just before saving the script Sort imports: Sort import statements using isort Max line length: Control how the formatter will wrap the lines, and controls the editor ruler The Formatter options allow for a selection between the autopep8 or black linting tools and provide the following additional options:\nLevel (autopep8 only) See Autopep8 aggressiveness level Normalize quotes (black only): Replace all single quotes with double quotes if possible Sorting operations are provided using isort, which will allow for sorting import statements in three different groups:\nstandard library imports (re, os, sys, json, ...) third-party modules (PyQt5, pandas, dateutil, ...) first-party modules (qgis, processing, ...) These operations will facilitate consistent development in line with industry best practices and improve code quality, consistency, readability, and operational efficiency (especially when coupled with version control systems).\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Toggle Python console to full main window ¶ Adds the same toggle button 3d map canvases and attribute tables to make it super-easy to switch the Python console to a full main window or back to a docked widget.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Reformat HTML Code in Code Editors ¶ Editors using the QgsCodeEditorHTML class will be able to use the code reformatting functionality to pretty print HTML data within QGIS. Note that this functionality will require the BeautifulSoup4 or lxml libraries to be installed within the python environment to parse the XML/ HTML data.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Even Rouault (Spatialys) ¶ Bug Title URL issues (Github, if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.28 backport commit (GitHub) GeoJSON IDs are barely supported (only reading string IDs is supported) #53214 Just analysis - fix out of scope unreported - [cleanup] QgsOgrFeatureIterator(): remove (hopefully!) useless code in subset string case \u0026quot;Order by\u0026quot;

Tiles can be loaded from either local or remote datasources (including the Cesium ion platform and the Google Earth photorealistic tiles), and are visible in both 2D and 3D map views. In 2D views users can control the appearance of tile content by styling in either their original textures or in a wireframe view of the tile geometries, and users also have control over the desired level of detail in both 3D and 2D views.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias and Nyall Dawson\nMap Tools ¶ Feature: Optional enforcement of \u0026quot;dot\u0026quot; as decimal separator for measure tool ¶ A new Always use decimal point checkbox option has been added to the Measure Tool. This option will ensure that measurements and coordinates are copied to the clipboard using a decimal point (dot) separator, even if the current locale uses a comma.\nThis enables the ability to copy comma-separated (csv) data even in instances where the user locale uses a comma as the decimal separator.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Show a highlight on identified raster pixels when using identify tool ¶ QGIS now displays the geometry of the identified feature result for raster pixels on the map canvas. This matches the existing behavior of the identify tool against vector, vector tile, and point cloud feature types.\nThis is useful when a identifying a raster which has sections of similar colored pixels and it's difficult to visually determine the exact extent of a pixel.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Show raster row/column of clicked point in identify results ¶ When using the identify tool on raster layers, the derived results will now include row and column number of the identified pixel.\nThis feature was developed by Hannes \u0026amp; Nyall Dawson\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Settings for overriding selection color and selection symbol for vector layers ¶ New layer rendering settings allow users to control the color and symbol that will be used in place of the system or project defaults when highlighting selected features.\nThis setting is defined for each layer and is useful to improve the visibility of selected features by the application of an explicitly defined symbology.\nThis is useful in various scenarios, including instances where:\nThe layer uses a symbol color or style that matches the selection symbology, resulting in the feature selection not being visible A line layer uses a thin symbol, and coloring selected lines does not make them visible enough Layers with complex symbology (such as raster/ gradient fills/ lines/ shapeburst with a color ramp) would not have a default selection color applied. In these scenarios, the user can now specify a simpler symbol to use for selected features within the layer. This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Toggle labels for Vector Tile Layers ¶ Users can now toggle labels for vector tile layers using the vector tile layer styling panel and the layer context menu in the table of contents of the layers pane, effectively replicating the label toggle capabilities for vector layers.\nThis functionality is enabled by the addition of new functions to the QgsVectorTileLayer API by replicating the existing functionality on QgsVectorLayer.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nRendering ¶ Feature: \u0026quot;Sticky\u0026quot; Map Decorations ¶ Dynamic map decorations are now rendered to a transparent overlay, preventing re-rendering of decoration objects (such as title or scale bar) during navigation. The QgsMapDecoration now also includes hasFixedMapPosition to fix a decoration to a geographic location.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Add map render profiler ¶ The debugging/ development profiling tools have been extended with a new \u0026quot;map render\u0026quot; profile (accompanying the existing Startup and Project Load profiles).\nThrough this tool, users are able to identify pain points in their map rendering and track down exactly which layers are causing long map redraws.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add choice of two different modes for \u0026quot;Refresh Layer at Interval\u0026quot; ¶ When using \u0026quot;Refresh Layer at Interval\u0026quot; on vector layers, previous versions of QGIS would simply redraw the layer (for animations etc.), without refreshing data from the data source.\nA new widget is provided which allows users to select the layer refresh options according to their preferred use case:\n\u0026quot;Reload Data\u0026quot;: The layer will be completely refreshed. Any cached data will be discarded and re-fetched from the provider. This mode may result in slower map refreshes. \u0026quot;Redraw Layer Only\u0026quot;: This mode is useful for animations or when the layer style should be updated at regular intervals. Canvas updates are deferred in order to avoid refreshing multiple times if more than one layer has an automatic update interval set. This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Allow GPU memory limit configuration ¶ Users are now able to configure the GPU memory limit configuration on each layer (previously fixed at 500MB per entity/ layer)\nA warning is also displayed when a limit is hit, which should assist in troubleshooting large scenes.\nThis functionality is useful for users utilizing large 3D scenes which exhaust the available GPU memory resources.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias\nFeature: Add support for boundingbox3d ¶ Additional API methods for relevant geometry classes are now available for boundingBox3D and calculateBoundingBox3D, as well as extensions to boundingBoxIntersects methods which will now support checking intersections between 3D bounding boxes.\nThis feature was developed by Jean Felder\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Select multiple layout items ¶ New functionality is provided for handling the selection of multiple items simultaneously from the item list within print layouts.\nThis also improves the user experience of multi-select existing functionality which is available with visual selections by keeping the item selection synchronized with the items list.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Layout Page number reflected in page properties ¶ When a layout has more than one page, the current page number will be displayed in the item properties header section using the format page_number/pagecount.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: Automatically open exported layouts ¶ A new \u0026quot;Open file after exporting\u0026quot; checkbox option has been added to the export options for PDF, SVG, and Image output types. When selected this option will attempt to automatically open the output file once the export is completed.\nThe application used to open the file will use the configured default application on the system based on type (using QDesktopServices::openUrl). This feature will leverage the user settings API to remember the selection for the active user profile.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Add bearing expression function ¶ A new bearing function has been added which computes the bearing angle (in radians) between two points.\nThe bearing is determined in the given CRS and measured clockwise on the given ellipsoid.\nThis feature was developed by Andrea Giudiceandrea\nFeature: Add \u0026quot;layer_crs_ellipsoid\u0026quot; ¶ QGIS expressions now include a layer_crs_ellipsoid layer variable, as well as the crs_ellipsoid property available from the layer_property function. The value returned will be the ellipsoid acronym of the layer CRS.\nThis feature was developed by Andrea Giudiceandrea\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Improve \u0026quot;avoid overlap\u0026quot; type awareness ¶ When digitizing features with the \u0026quot;avoid overlap\u0026quot; option, QGIS has improved the behavior of automatically coercing the feature type and includes more meaningful messages to notify users of the automated behaviours.\nAn example use case would be the digitizing of a multipart polygon on a singlepart polygon target layer, which cannot be saved. QGIS will now automatically only keep the largest geometry portion, and prompt users to optionally restore the additional features as singlepart polygons.\nThis prevents the digitizing of \u0026quot;sliver\u0026quot; polygons and frustrations with improper feature types.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nData Management ¶ Feature: Improve save vector features handling for pre-existing files ¶ When using the save vector features to file algorithm, QGIS will inform users of the default behavior for handling pre-existing files (file overwrite) and provide the abiltiy to select from a range of alternate behaviors (such as overwrite layer or append new features to existing layer)\nThis greatly improves the ability for users to manage data using flat file data storage formats such as geopackage, whilst minimizing the risk of data loss or unwanted side effects.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Maintain relations for copied features ¶ New functionality ensures that copied features within the same layer will continue to respect project relationship(s) strength.\nWhen copying features within the same vector layer using the map, attribute table, or the copy/ move feature(s) tool, QGIS will now track any relationship within the opened project and duplicate features with the relations intact.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: Support raster band description ¶ QGIS will now show band descriptions in the symbology tab for raster layers, in addition to the band number.\nThis feature was funded by Summer is getting warmer and warmer.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Antialias setting for raster tile processing plugin ¶ A new \u0026quot;Enable antialiasing\u0026quot; parameter has been added to the \u0026quot;Generate XYZ Tiles\u0026quot; processing tool.\nThis option will be enabled by default (replicating the current behavior) but allow users to disable the antialiasing of map content.\nThis feature was developed by ASAI Hitoshi\nFeature: Create Grid row_index and col_index fields ¶ Fields for the row_index and col_index have been added to the output of the \u0026quot;Create Grid\u0026quot; processing algorithm. The fields are added to all outputs of type point, rectangle, and hexagon.\nField values are integers for which the count begins at 0 and increments from left to right (column index) and top to bottom (row index).\nThis feature was developed by Valentin Buira\nFeature: New 'Calculate expression' algorithm for use in models ¶ The new \u0026quot;Calculate expression\u0026quot; algorithm will calculate the results of a QGIS expression and make the result available for use in other parts of the model.\nIt avoids the need to use the same expression multiple times throughout a model if the same result needs to be used more than once and provides additional use cases (such as generating a static timestamp value for use throughout a model).\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add algorithm to convert content from a GLTF/GLB file to standard vector layer features ¶ QGIS now allows the conversion of 3D tile content in GLTF and GLB formats into editable vector feature formats.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Port SAGA \u0026quot;DTM Filter (slope-based)\u0026quot; tool to a native QGIS algorithm ¶ The SAGA DTM Filter tool has been ported to a native QGIS algorithm.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Clear recently opened project list ¶ A \u0026quot;Clear Recently Opened\u0026quot; action is now listed at the bottom of the Project → Open Recent menu, which will remove every unpinned project from the menu.\nAn additional context menu is also available to enable the ability to remove individual projects from the recent project list, as well as \u0026quot;pin\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;unpin\u0026quot; items.\nThe state will be synchronized between the recent projects menu and the QGIS Welcome Page.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nFeature: OAUTH2 PKCE Authorization Code ¶ An implementation of Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE, RFC 7636) has been added for OAUTH2 Authorization Code flows, improving resilience to CSRF and code injection attacks.\nThis feature was funded by Comune di Roma\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Set processing defaults from QGIS configuration file ¶ QGIS now supports the capability to configure the default values for GUI tools within the QGIS Processing framework using parameters specified in the QGIS.ini settings file.\nThis allows for the configuration of user-specific or organization-wide default values for certain algorithms. For example, to set the default value of the GRID_SIZE (precision) parameter on the intersection algorithm, the following configuration may be added to the QGIS/QGIS3.ini in the active user profile directory root:\n[Processing] DefaultGuiParam\\native%3Aintersection\\GRID_SIZE=0.01 When a user with this configuration opens the relevant toolbox to execute an algorithm, the default value will be specified for them automatically.\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nProfile Plots ¶ Feature: Add setting to control background color for elevation profile charts ¶ This option (available from the new Settings → Options → Elevation tab) allows users to set a specific color to use as the background color for elevation profiles.\nThis can make the chart more readable for certain datasets, e.g. point clouds with RGB coloring, where the default background color is too similar to point colors to be easily discernable.\nThis is an opt-in setting, and by default the elevation profiles will continue to display using the standard system background color.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Discover relations for Oracle provider ¶ QGIS now supports the automated discovery of relations for the Oracle data provider.\nThis feature was funded by Métropole de Lille\nThis feature was developed by Jacky Volpes\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Drop interactive shell from GRASS C++ Plugin ¶ For maintenance reasons, the interactive shell for the GRASS C++ Plugin, as well as the embedded QTermWidget, have been removed from future releases.\nIt is expected that the GRASS Processing Plugin will be given priority development and maintenance support going forward, and providing an interactive GRASS shell is not a critical functionality for QGIS itself but rather something that users may manage externally.\nFurther details on the specifics of this feature cleanup can be found on the feature Pull Request.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Function to export runtime profiler model content as text ¶ A new function has been added to allow for the export of the current runtime profiler (QgsRuntimeProfiler) model content as a multi-line text string.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti (itOpen / qcooperative) ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.28 backport commit (GitHub) QGIS cannot connect to MySQL if user's password contains commas. #54493 PR #54573 No QGIS WFS server will look for .qgz file in wrong place if \u0026quot;map\u0026quot; is in path #54533 PR #54639 PR #54855 Raster layer transparency/opacity not stored in saved style #54496 PR #54644 PR #54854 WMS GetPrint with ATLAS_PK has incorrect layers visibility in versions \u0026gt;= 3.22 #54475 PR #54651 PR #54663 Error saving edit on PostGIS geometry when table also contains geography #54572 PR #54664 PR #54714 Cant subtract or add angles since the degrees symbol has been added #54501 PR #54687 N/A WCS Keep Unavailable Layers #54702 PR #54707 N/A taxon legend from map whis atlas #54654 PR #54692 N/A Spinbox for colum space in legends does not allow to set values above 99.99 units #54682 PR #54709 N/A Geometry Error SpatiaLite Database #54662 PR #54734 N/A Splitting MultiLineStrings gives awkward results #54155 PR #54744 PR #54851 Open project, then layer properties, close, close project: qgis thinks something has changed #54741 PR #54757 N/A Width field of attribute tables in print layouts only uses locale when being edited #54204 PR #54769 PR #54781 Data Source Manger - Browser: Close and Help buttons are missing #54171 PR #54770 N/A 0 port in OAuth2 callback URI #54562 Cannot reproduce N/A QGIS Crashes when editing multiple features simultaneously that have a Value Relation field #54164 PR #54889 TODO Crash when playing with duplicated legends in layout #52268 PR #54947 QGIS fails to request more than one WMS-Layer #55042 PR #55064 N/A This feature was funded by QGIS.ORG (through donations and sustaining memberships)\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti (itOpen / qcooperative)\nFeature: Bug fixes by Even Rouault (Spatialys) ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.28 backport commit (GitHub) qgsgeos.cpp: fix a -Wunused-variable warning unreported PR #54612 N/A qgsvirtualpointcloudprovider.cpp: add a missing variable initialization unreported PR #54613 N/A OAPIF does not honour the view extent QGIS user mailing list PR #54617 PR #54792 Does QGIS require units \u0026quot;m\u0026quot; for the projection coordinate variables in a netCDF/CF file?

The project continues to empower users to make even better spatial decisions with new features and improvements, and introduces a new core data provider for OGC SensorThings API data sources.\nAbout our release name: Windsor and Maidenhead borough council was one of the first UK local authorities to move to QGIS (at version 1.8!) back in 2010/11. It was at Windsor and Maidenhead that Simon Miles and Matt Travis started the UK QGIS user group. It even hosted the first ever UK user group meeting. Windsor and Maidenhead also contributed financial to many an QGIS plugin and was also a bronze sponsor.\nAmong the exciting new features added to this release is a new \u0026ldquo;Movie Mode\u0026rdquo; for the temporal controller that facilitates the production of animated maps. This release also brings new functionalities for map tips (on Desktop and Server) and improvements to the growing collection of 3D functionality, giving users the power to take advantage of advanced data types, such as Meshes, Point Clouds, and 3D Tiles.\nFor a whirlwind tour of all the new functionalities introduced, you can view the highlight reel video on YouTube.\nQGIS is a community effort, and we would like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible. From the QGIS community, we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate time, money, or otherwise contribute towards making QGIS more awesome, please wander along to QGIS.ORG and lend a hand!\nQGIS is supported by donors and sustaining members.

Sponsoring QGIS helps us to fund our regular developer meetings, maintain project infrastructure, and fund bug-fixing efforts. A complete list of current sponsors is provided below - our very thank you to all of our sponsors!\nQGIS is free software and you are under no obligation to pay anything to use it - in fact, we want to encourage people far and wide to use it regardless of their financial or social status - we believe that empowering people with spatial decision-making tools will result in a better society for all of humanity.\nBreaking Changes ¶ Feature: OTB Processing provider removed ¶ Due to a lack of ongoing maintenance, we\u0026rsquo;ve made the difficult decision to remove the Orfeo ToolBox (OTB) Processing provider from QGIS. Any users, plugins or scripts which require this functionality will need to be modified accordingly.\nMotivated members from the QGIS community are encouraged to create a 3rd party community maintained plugin to restore OTB support.\nTemporal ¶ Feature: \u0026ldquo;Movie Mode\u0026rdquo; for the temporal controller ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added a brand new \u0026ldquo;Movie\u0026rdquo; mode to the temporal controller. This mode has been designed to facilitate creating animated movies from maps. Unlike the other temporal controller modes, while movie mode is activated no time-based filtering of data is performed.\nIn movie mode, you can set the total number of frames for your movie and the animation will progress frame by frame for that number of frames, advancing the current map settings frame (and @frame_number expression variable) at each step. You can then use animated symbols, or alter your symbology using the @frame_number expression variable, to create dynamic, animated maps.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Custom layer properties in map layer properties ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added display of custom layer properties for map layers within the layer properties information tab, making it easy for users to view any additional metadata and properties attached to their map layers.\nThis feature was developed by Jorge Alexandre Delesderrier da Silva\nFeature: Easier project and image saving ¶ In 3.36, we\u0026rsquo;ve made QGIS a little bit cleverer in the way it handles saving of projects and images. The project type (.qgz, .qgs) or image format (.png, .jpg, .tif, etc.) is now (by default) determined by any file extension you\u0026rsquo;ve typed in the save dialog. This allows for a faster user experience when changing from one format to another, as you don\u0026rsquo;t need to manually set an explicit format in advance via the format combo box!\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin (OPENGIS.ch)\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Control image height for raster fill symbol layers ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve introduced a new setting for the \u0026ldquo;raster fill\u0026rdquo; symbol type, which allows you to control the width and height of the fill pattern independently. (Previously these settings were locked to each other). You\u0026rsquo;re now able to create stretched raster fills in the horizontal or vertical directions, giving more flexibility for your custom symbol creation.\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New \u0026ldquo;Filled line\u0026rdquo; symbol layer type ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added a brand new line symbol type for \u0026ldquo;filled lines\u0026rdquo;. Much like the older \u0026ldquo;Filled marker\u0026rdquo; symbol type offers for marker symbols, this option will render lines using any QGIS fill symbol. This means you can now render lines filled with gradients, line hatches, raster fills, and much more!\nThis feature was funded by North Road, thanks to SLYR\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nMesh ¶ Feature: Mesh labeling ¶ In 3.36 we\u0026rsquo;ve added labeling support for mesh layers. Labels can be applied to mesh vertices, or mesh faces, and can take advantage of all the advanced formatting options and appearance settings that you get for vector labels. Labelling settings are available through layer properties dialog and the layer styling panel. Toggling mesh labels on and off can also be conveniently done through the layer panel\u0026rsquo;s context menu.\nThis feature was funded by GÖTEBORGS STAD\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis (Lutra Consulting)\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Data defined color control for simple 3d line rendering ¶ You can now set a data-defined, dynamic color for 3D lines rendered using the \u0026ldquo;Render as simple 3D lines\u0026rdquo; option. This is extremely useful for visualising line features in 3D, eg displaying underground pipelines in different colors based on their classifications.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved \u0026ldquo;Phong\u0026rdquo; material and lighting ¶ The Phong shader is used as the default material for showing vector features in QGIS 3D views. For 3.36, this shader has been improved to better handle ambient and shininess parameters. Additionally, we\u0026rsquo;ve taken care to ensure that the exact same shading will apply regardless of the underlying geometry type (points, lines or polygons), and regardless of whether data defined symbol colors are in use. This gives users a much more predictable and easy-to-configure material for their 3D views.\nFor easier configuration of nicer-looking materials, we also added new controls for modifying the strength of the ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting contributions.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: \u0026ldquo;Physically based\u0026rdquo; metal rough material ¶ For even more beautiful 3D maps, we\u0026rsquo;ve added a new material choice for a \u0026ldquo;physically based rendering\u0026rdquo; (PBR) material. This material lets you define the base color of the surface, and how \u0026ldquo;metal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;rough\u0026rdquo; it should appear. This material is simple to configure and get great results from, and is expected to become the default material in a future QGIS release.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Define 3D scene extents on 2D maps ¶ We added a shortcut action to the 3D map toolbar that allows users to quickly draw an extent limit for the scene on a 2D map.\nThis feature was funded by Natural Resources Canada\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis (Lutra Consulting)\nPoint Clouds ¶ Feature: Size overrides for point cloud classification ¶ In QGIS 3.36 you can now override the default point size for discrete categories in both 2D and 3D views.\nA new \u0026ldquo;Size\u0026rdquo; column was added to the categories widget, which will appear blank when a category inherits the default point size but allows you to manually specify the size with numeric input. Setting the Size value to 0 for a category will reset it to use the layer\u0026rsquo;s default point size.\nYou can also use the right-click context menu to set the point size for multiple selected categories at once.\nThis feature was funded by Natural Resources Canada\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Render point clouds as a surface in 2D maps ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added a new option for 2D styling of Point Clouds that for \u0026ldquo;Render as a Surface (Triangulate)\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen enabled, QGIS will perform an on-the-fly Delaunay triangulation of the points in the current map view and render the layer as filled triangles instead of individual points. The color of each point is maintained and interpolated within each triangle.\nGlobal map shading is also supported with the new option so that, when enabled, the elevation of points is retained and a rasterized instance of the triangles with interpolated elevations can be provided to the elevation map.\nWhen \u0026ldquo;Render as a surface\u0026rdquo; is enabled, drawing order is ignored and all input points participate in the triangulation.\nWe also added an option to filter large triangles (based on the maximum length of an edge of a triangle), which allows for visualizing data gaps, but the 2D rendering only provides filtering based on the horizontal length of triangles.\nBe sure to check out the feature Pull Request on GitHub for a showcase of the new functionality in different modes and contexts.\nThis feature was funded by National Resources Canada\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Faster point cloud rendering by caching decoded data blocks ¶ Want even faster point cloud rendering? Well, QGIS now supports rendering point clouds faster by using a cache for storing nodes which have already been decoded.\nThis optimisation avoids decompressing the same nodes multiple times when panning or zooming, especially when using compressed data sources such as LAZ formatted files.\n(A fixed size cache of 200MB is used and shared across all point cloud layers and canvases (2D, 3D, and Profile Plots).)\nThis feature was funded by Natural Resources Canada\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Metadata preservation during COPC conversion ¶ The Untwine tool (which is responsible for conversions of point clouds to the COPC format within QGIS) has been updated to version 1.3. This includes various fixes and small enhancements. Among the enhancements, the conversion to COPC now preserves the following metadata from LAS/LAZ files:\nGlobal encoding Creation time (year+day) XYZ offset This feature was funded by Natural Resources Canada\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Better handling of classification flags ¶ LAS/LAZ files may include four flags for each point (synthetic, key-point, withheld, overlap). In older QGIS releases, they have all been exposed in ClassificationFlags as a combined single value. This has been impractical when a user needs to use one of those flags for filtering or visualization.\nFor version 3.36, we reworked things so that these flags are available as separate attributes both for visualization (eg using the Classification renderer) and for filtering in expressions. Accordingly, we\u0026rsquo;ve removed the older ClassificationFlags attribute.\nThis feature was funded by National Resources Canada\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis (Lutra Consulting)\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Alias of minimum/maximum for min/max in aggregates ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added some new aliases for arguments to the aggregate expression functions, so that \u0026ldquo;minimum\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;maximum\u0026rdquo; can be used instead of \u0026ldquo;min\u0026rdquo; and\u0026quot;max\u0026quot; for these functions.\nThis feature was developed by Harrissou Sant-anna\nFeature: @counter variable for array_foreach ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added a new \u0026ldquo;@counter\u0026rdquo; variable to the array_foreach function in expressions. Among other things, this lets you combine values across multiple array fields.\nExample:\narray_foreach( \u0026quot;field_1\u0026quot;, @element || ' ' || \u0026quot;field_2\u0026quot;[@counter] )\nThis feature was developed by Björn Hinkeldey\nFeature: Improved expression insertion ¶ To make QGIS 3.36 even more user-friendly, we\u0026rsquo;ve tweaked the \u0026ldquo;Insert/Edit Expression\u0026rdquo; behavior. Now,\nIf some text is selected and your selection is within an expression (i.e. between \u0026ldquo;[%\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;%]\u0026rdquo;), the expression editor will select the whole expression If no text is selected, and your cursor is inside an expression, the whole expression is selected Otherwise, the expression editor will open with your existing selection. Additionally, we added a new \u0026ldquo;Insert/Edit Expression\u0026rdquo; button to the vector layer properties MapTip tab.\nThis new expression editing behavior also applies to Print Layout labels, Titles, and Copyright decorations, as well as Annotation items.\nThis feature was developed by Yoann Quenach de Quivillic\nData Management ¶ Feature: Toggle Selection in the Organize columns window ¶ We added a Toggle Selection button to the Organize Columns dialog to improve your ability to manage datasets with a large number of fields.\nThe new Toggle Selection button (as well as the Deselect or Select All buttons) will only appear when there are more than 5 fields in a layer.\nThis feature was developed by Valentin Buira\nProcessing ¶ Feature: \u0026ndash;skip-loading-plugins flag for qgis_process ¶ The qgis_process command line interface tool benefits from a new --skip-loading-plugins argument. If specified, this can result in faster execution times for commands such as qgis_process plugins, which can now list the installed plugins **without** loading them.\nThis feature was funded by Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Click to open output paths in processing logs ¶ A super-helpful new shortcut we added to 3.36 is that any output paths (such as file, folder, or HTML outputs) in the Processing log are now clickable, allowing you to directly open the containing folder and preselect the generated file!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Vector coverage algorithms ¶ QGIS 3.36 introduces a number of new tools for working with vector coverage layers. \u0026ldquo;Vector coverages\u0026rdquo; are polygon layers where the features are expected to neighbour each other, without overlaps or gaps, such as administrative boundary layers. These new Processing algorithms expose tools for working with coverages, including:\nValidate coverage: This algorithm analyzes a coverage to find places where the assumption of exactly matching edges is not met. Simplify coverage: This algorithm applies a Visvalingam–Whyatt simplification to the edges in a coverage, while retaining a valid coverage (ie no edges will cross or touch after the simplification) Dissolve coverage: This algorithm provides a heavily optimised approach for unioning polygons from a coverage layer, when compared against the standard Dissolve tools. These new tools rely on functionality from the GEOS geometry handling library. Our thanks go to the GEOS maintainers for making this work possible!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved Export Layers to DXF algorithm ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve introduced a number of new parameters to the \u0026ldquo;Export Layers to DXF\u0026rdquo; algorithm , to match the functionality of its non-Processing counterpart:\nAn extent parameter to filter features to be exported A map theme parameter to override the layers\u0026rsquo; symbology when exporting We\u0026rsquo;ve also fixed several shortcomings in the algorithm, including skipping layers within which no features were exported.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Swiss User Group (QGIS-CH)\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Faster GRASS Provider startup ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve reworked the backend of the Processing GRASS Provider, which helps reduce the startup times for this plugin (especially on Windows installations!). This is especially beneficial for users of the qgis_process tool, who will experience noticeably faster execution times for this tool.\nThis feature was funded by Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Faster qgis_process startup ¶ For 3.36, we\u0026rsquo;ve substantially improved the startup speed of the qgis_process command. This was done by applying a variety of optimisations inside QGIS, such as lazy loading of the authentication and style library frameworks so that these frameworks are only initialised when required, and by reworking the logic for migrating user settings between different QGIS versions to avoid unnecessary work.\nTogether, these improvements have reduced qgis_process startup times from multiple seconds to less than one second!\nThis feature was funded by Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: \u0026ldquo;localhost\u0026rdquo; option for OAuth2 Redirects ¶ Some OAuth2 providers, like Microsoft Sharepoint, require specific redirect hosts for security reasons. They may not accept the standard \u0026ldquo;http://127.0.0.1\u0026rdquo; redirect, but instead allow only \u0026ldquo;https://127.0.0.1\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;http://localhost\u0026rdquo;.\nTo ensure compatibility with these providers without the complexity of setting up HTTPS, we added a new option to use \u0026ldquo;localhost\u0026rdquo; as the redirect host for OAuth2 authentication.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Serial port sensor baudrate selection ¶ For 3.36 you can now customize the connection speed (baud rate) to use for serial port sensors. Previously, this parameter was hardcoded at 9600 baud, limiting compatibility with various sensor types, such as NMEA sensors requiring 4800 baud. You can now connect to a wider array of sensors by adjusting the baud rate to meet specific requirements.\nThis feature was developed by Jorge Tornero\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Open layers with Datasource Manager from browser ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve introduced a new option in the QGIS browser context menu for \u0026ldquo;Open with Datasource Manager\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. This option is available for layers which use the OGR provider (including GPKG sources), GDAL provider (raster layers), and Spatialite layers. When activated, a dialog will open on the data source tab of the layer properties, with relevant field values prepopulated to open the layer directly in QGIS, which allows you to set more comprehensive file opening options directly from the browser.\nThis functionality brings with it the ConfigureFromUri method which has been developed for the Python and C++ APIs. This method will enable source selection widgets to open and configure the data source manager directly from a data source URI, allowing the development of more sophisticated data loading options such as within plugins and when using the Change Data Source utility.\nThis feature was funded by NOAA\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nData Providers ¶ Feature: SensorThings Data Provider ¶ For version 3.36 we\u0026rsquo;ve introduced a brand new core data provider for OGC SensorThings API data sources.\nThe SensorThings API is an OGC specification for Internet of Things sensors which complements existing communication protocols within the IoT ecosystem.\nThis functionality was developed in line with QEP 257 and introduces new panels within the QGIS Browser, Data Source Manager, and Layer Properties Source tab for users to configure connections to SensorThings data sources.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve taken care to ensure that SensorThings data sources are loaded in the most optimised way possible, providing an streamlined, user-friendly way to load SensorThings data into your QGIS projects. This is just the beginning though, and we\u0026rsquo;ve more functionality and improvements planned for access to SensorThings sources in QGIS 3.38!\nThis feature was funded by BRGM and Water4All Partnership\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Support for WFS documents with complex feature schemas ¶ We enhanced the WFS Provider to add support for complex feature schemas. The implementation exposes properties of complex WFS types as JSON content, converted from their original XML representations.\nFor more details, see the QGIS Enhancement Proposal.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS user group Germany\nThis feature was developed by Even Rouault\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: WMS GetMap in PDF Format ¶ QGIS Server will now support responses in PDF format for GetMap requests.\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nFeature: QGIS Server Properties Tab for Vector Tile Layers ¶ The Layer Properties Dialog for Vector Tile layers will now include a section for editing the QGIS Server layer settings, providing the ability to configure layer-specific settings such as shortname, abstract, and other metadata.\nThis feature was developed by Sandro Mani\nFeature: GetLegendGraphics JSON rule ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added a new SHOWRULEDETAILS parameter for WMS services, which will append a rule item in the legend entry. The rule describes the filter expression used on the respective layer when performing a GetLegendGraphic request using the JSON format option.\nFor example, the request:\ntext GET /?SERVICE=WMS\u0026amp;VERSION=1.30\u0026amp;REQUEST=GetLegendGraphic\u0026amp;LAYERS=layer1\u0026amp;FORMAT=application/json\u0026amp;SHOWRULEDETAILS=1\nWill return the JSON response which includes a rule field when appropriate:\njson This feature was funded by Kristianstadt\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Add maptip for raster layer GetFeatureInfo ¶ Maptip support was added for raster layer GetFeatureInfo responses, when requesting with parameter WITH_MAPTIP=TRUE. This matches the existing behavior which was in place for vector layers.\nIn this context, the variable layer_cursor_point holds the GetFeatureInfo position, so that maptips which are working in QGIS desktop are working also with QGIS Server GetFeatureInfo.\nThis feature was developed by Björn Hinkeldey\nFeature: WMS parameter to request only maptip for HTML feature info responses ¶ We added a new value HTML_FI_ONLY_MAPTIP for the existing WMS vendor parameter WITH_MAPTIP.\nIf set, the feature info HTML response includes only the maptip, which gives full control over the HTML response using e.g. the built-in maptip editor which has a nice preview.\nThis feature was developed by Björn Hinkeldey\nFeature: Option to skip \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo; attribute for groups in WMS GetCapabilities ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added a new project level setting to Skip name attribute for groups. This is disabled by default, but enabling it allows you to exclude group names from a GetCapabilities response on a WMS request. This prevents name duplication in instances where a layer and group share the same name, whilst preserving the group element and bringing the QGIS Server capabilities more in line with the OGC WMS Specification.\nFor example:\ntext \u0026lt;Layer queryable=\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Name\u0026gt;layer_name\u0026lt;/Name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;--- this will be skipped when option is enabled \u0026lt;Title\u0026gt;Human readable name\u0026lt;/Title\u0026gt;\nThis feature was developed by Tomas Straupis\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Use active layer when importing vector data with DB Manager ¶ When importing vector data in the DB Manager core plugin, the \u0026ldquo;Input\u0026rdquo; combo box, which is populated with all the vector data in the layer tree, is now automatically set to the active layer whenever possible. This small change makes it much more user-friendly, especially when working with large and complex projects!\nThis feature was developed by Patrice Pineault\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Expose 3D views to PyQGIS ¶ You now have the ability to create, list, and close 3D views from Python, matching the functionality of their 2D counterparts.\nWe refactored a number of application classes to introduce support the following iface methods:\ncreateNewMapCanvas3D: Creates a named 3D view instance closeMapCanvas3D: Closes a 3D view by name mapCanvases3D: List existing 3D views in the project context Example:\n```\niface.createNewMapCanvas3D(\u0026lsquo;my new 3d view\u0026rsquo;) iface.mapCanvases3D() [] iface.closeMapCanvas3D(\u0026lsquo;my new 3d view\u0026rsquo;) iface.mapCanvases3D() [] ```\nThis feature was funded by Natural Resources Canada\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Optimised methods to convert GeoJSON geometries to QgsGeometry ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added some highly optimised methods which allow direct construction of geometries (QgsGeometry) from raw JSON objects, instead of requiring translation through another library\u0026rsquo;s geometry structures. These methods are exposed through the new API call QgsJsonUtils.geometryFromGeoJson.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Qt WebEngine classes can now be used by plugins ¶ In older QGIS versions, an incompatibility between the modern Qt \u0026ldquo;WebEngine\u0026rdquo; classes and QGIS\u0026rsquo; 3D framework prevented QGIS plugins from using any WebEngine widgets. This was a significant shortcoming, as the older Qt \u0026ldquo;WebKit\u0026rdquo; widgets were very limited, slow, and did not support many modern JavaScript essentials.\nIn 3.36, we\u0026rsquo;ve reworked how QGIS 3D is initialised to remove this incompatibility. Scripts and plugins can now safely use Qt\u0026rsquo;s WebEngine classes without issue!\nThis feature was funded by https://qgis.org\nThis feature was developed by QGIS.org\nFeature: Vertical and compound Coordinate Reference System support in CRS widgets ¶ As part of the ongoing QGIS grant project for vertical CRS handling (see QEP 267), all of QGIS\u0026rsquo; coordinate reference system can now be set to show only vertical or compound CRS. This allows plugins and scripts to present users with choices of vertical CRS, ready for use in QgsCoordinateTransform objects for vertical CRS transformations.\nSee QgsCoordinateReferenceSystemProxyModel.Filter for the available CRS filtering options for use in these widgets.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.org\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Python support in Qt6 builds ¶ While version 5.15 remains the recommended Qt version for compiling QGIS, we\u0026rsquo;ve been hard at work adding full support for Qt 6 builds of QGIS. This is necessary in order to support modern desktop requirements, such as full compatibility with Wayland based Linux environments and for optimised Apple silicon builds.\nQGIS 3.36 brings support for running Python under Qt 6 builds, and enables use of the PyQGIS library within Qt 6. This is a significant milestone in our ongoing journey towards full support for Qt 6!\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.org\nFeature: Add meshMenu to QGIS Interface ¶ meshMenu has been added to the iface object, giving plugins and scripts an easy way to extend the Mesh menu.\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti\nFeature: Server: onProjectReady method for filter plugins ¶ The new onProjectReady method is called after the QgsProject instance is ready for a server request and before entering the main logic for core services.\nThe onRequestReady method is called after the QgsRequestHandler is ready and populated with parameters, but before the QgsProject instance is ready.\nYou can use onProjectReady to perform operations at the project level, like adding variables, checking vector layer categories, etc.\nThis feature was funded by 3Liz\nThis feature was developed by rldhont\nFeature: Add fuzzy comparisons methods ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added new methods for fuzzyEquals and fuzzyDistanceEquals to the QGIS geometry classes. These methods compare geometric objects with a tolerance for small variations, enhancing the precision of equality and distance calculations. They will be particularly useful in scenarios where exact matches may not be feasible or necessary.\n```python epsilon = 0.001 geom1 = QgsLineString(QgsPoint(0.0, 0.0), QgsPoint(0.001, 0.001)) geom2 = QgsLineString(QgsPoint(0.0, 0.0), QgsPoint(0.002, 0.002))\nself.assertNotEqual(geom1, geom2) # epsilon = 1e-8 here\nself.assertTrue(geom1.fuzzyEqual(geom2, epsilon)) self.assertFalse(geom1.fuzzyDistanceEqual(geom2, epsilon)) ```\nThis feature was funded by QGIS.ORG (through GRANT)\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti\nFeature: Measured line methods ¶ In QGIS 3.36 we\u0026rsquo;ve introduced a measuredLine method within Qgs(Multi)LineString. This method builds upon the code from PostGIS behind ST_AddMeasure.\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti (itOpen / qcooperative) ¶ Bug Title | URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) | URL Commit (Github) | 3.34 backport commit (GitHub) \u0026ndash;

This release includes enhanced data filtering capabilities and the tight integration of filter criteria across different project elements, providing extended control to empower users in refining their data exploration processes.\nVarious improvements have been provided for elevation management, including the new elevation controller as well as the ability to explicitly declare a vertical CRS for your project. Previous releases actively removed vertical CRS information for technical reasons, as outlined in QGIS Enhancement Proposal 267, however, this vital aspect of spatial data management is now being reintroduced to the QGIS project.\nBeyond these core improvements, QGIS 3.38 boasts a wealth of enhancements and quality-of-life improvements, including various usability enhancements, CMYK color support, improved search functionalities, and new features for data types such as DXF, Mesh, and SensorThings.\nFor a whirlwind tour of all the new functionalities introduced, you can view the highlight reel video on YouTube.\nQGIS is a community effort, and we would like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible. From the QGIS community, we hope you enjoy this release!

There\u0026rsquo;s a configure action for setting the project\u0026rsquo;s elevation range, which dictates the range available from the widget.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add Z range support to map canvas / map settings items ¶ Elevation filtering is now supported in map canvases\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Add option to set a fixed elevation slice width for elevation controller ¶ A new option is provided on the configuration menu of the elevation controller, which allows for setting a fixed elevation slice width.\nIt can be used when a specific elevation range width is desired, or when the range should always be zero width.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Add search option for regular expression based searching ¶ A new optional regex mode has been exposed for advanced search options, as implemented in the updated search functionality for the code editor.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Data defined override: use middle-click to open the Expression Builder dialog window ¶ Description ¶ The middle-click on the Data defined override icon makes the Expression Builder dialog window open, as a convenient shortcut for right-clicking and then left-clicking on the Edit menu item.\nThis feature was developed by Andrea Giudiceandrea\nSymbology ¶ Feature: New single color renderer for rasters ¶ A new single-color symbology has been added for raster layers. This allows for a super simple and friendly way to render a raster using a single color.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Add support for Wind Barb rendering for mesh vector datasets ¶ Wind Barbs are a common way to display wind strength and direction on maps, and the new Wind Barb symbology type makes it easy for users to use this powerful visualization style for their mesh vector datasets.\nWind barbs encode the wind speed in knots (nautical miles per hour) so users must explicitly select the relevant data units for their data to display correctly, or use a custom multiplier to convert the value to knots.\nThis feature was developed by Stefanos Natsis\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Add maximum distance setting for point labels ¶ A new optional setting has been added for the \u0026ldquo;Around point\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cartographic\u0026rdquo; placement modes to specify the maximum distance of the labels from the feature. It\u0026rsquo;s used together with the existing distance setting to define a range of distances at which labels may be placed from their corresponding point features.\nThis adds more flexibility to the placement of these layers, ultimately allowing for more labels to be placed on busy maps.\nWhen the layer is set to the \u0026ldquo;around point\u0026rdquo; mode, then label candidates that are closer to the point will always be preferred over those that are further away.\nWhen the layer is set to the \u0026ldquo;cartographic\u0026rdquo; mode, then the default behavior is also to prioritize closer labels. A new combo box allows users to control the priority, with an option for preferring position ordering. If this option is set, candidates at the corresponding positions (e.g. top left) are preferred, regardless of how far they are from the point, with the labeling falling back to alternate positions only when no labels can be placed up to the maximum label distance.\nThis feature was funded by Rubicon Concierge Real Estate Services\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add \u0026lsquo;over point\u0026rsquo; placement option for cartographic label mode ¶ A new option for label placement has been added for \u0026ldquo;O\u0026rdquo; = \u0026ldquo;over point\u0026rdquo; when the label placement mode is set to the \u0026ldquo;cartographic\u0026rdquo; mode.\nWhen a feature\u0026rsquo;s data-defined placement priorities include this new \u0026lsquo;O\u0026rsquo; option, a label can be placed directly over the corresponding point.\nThis feature was funded by Rubicon Concierge Real Estate Services\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nRendering ¶ Feature: Add data defined control over heatmap radius and maximum value ¶ This allows users to define the radius and maximum as a value that makes sense for the current situation, e.g. the current map scale, current print atlas feature, or current temporal range.\nThis additionally includes the base changes required for data-defined properties at the feature renderer level, which may be useful for extending other vector renderer classes (e.g. point cluster/ displacement).\nThis feature was funded by Rubicon Concierge Real Estate Services\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Tab character support for QgsTextFormat and QgsTextRenderer ¶ A regression resulted in QGIS stripping tab characters and limiting the ability to use tab characters in certain contexts, such as performing character alignment in legends.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Copy composer grids ¶ A button to copy (duplicate) the selected grid has been added to the print composer.\nThis simplifies the process of creating new grids which only have a few differences from an existing grid or using an existing grid as a template.\nThis feature was funded by NaturalGIS\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: Add z range filter option for layout maps ¶ A new setting for layout map items allows users to set a specific elevation/z range for the filtering of 2D layout maps, similar to the existing setting for temporal filters.\nWhen set, map layers supporting 2D z-range filtering will be filtered to show only content within this range.\nAdditionally, the range for z-filtering can be data-defined, allowing different z-ranges for atlas or report features based on data-driven feature properties.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add buttons to expand or collapse layout legend tree ¶ New buttons have been added to allow users to easily expand or collapse the legend trees within print layouts.\nThis feature was developed by Harrissou Sant-anna\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Add @map_z_range variables reflecting the map\u0026rsquo;s z range values ¶ New variables for retrieving the current @map_z_range_lower and @map_z_range_upper values have been added to QGIS Expressions that reflect the map canvas\u0026rsquo; z range value.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nData Management ¶ Feature: Duplicate policy on fields when duplicating features ¶ When duplicating a feature (and its children) a new duplication policy will be available on QgsField objects.\nThis behavior can be configured using the policies interface in the layers feature form definition, however, the actively defined policy will be implemented on any features duplicated using generic map tools whenever a feature is copied (e.g. \u0026ldquo;move and copy\u0026rdquo; digitizing, or copy and pasting from the canvas or attribute table).\nThere are three policy options currently available:\nDuplicate Value (default mode): Creates a copy of the attribute value from the source feature. Default Value: Not to be confused with the default mode, the default value setting resets new features to the feature form default as defined in the form designer (typically a QGIS Expression). Remove Value: Unsets and removes the field value (NULL). This feature was developed by signedav\nFeature: Add \u0026ldquo;Fixed Time Range Per Band\u0026rdquo; mode for raster temporal control ¶ This mode can be used when each band in the raster layer is associated with a fixed time range, eg. NetCDF files.\nThe user can either manually populate a table with begin/end dates for each band in the raster or build the table using QGIS expressions which return datetime values\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Introduce fixed elevation range for raster layers ¶ A new option has been introduced for specifying how elevation is associated with raster layers. It permits a fixed elevation range to be set for the layer and can be used when the layer has a single fixed elevation or a range (slice) of elevation values.\nUsers can set the lower and upper elevation range for the layer, and whether the lower or upper limits are inclusive or exclusive.\nWhen enabled, the layer will only be visible in 2D maps with elevation filtering active if the layer\u0026rsquo;s range is included in the z range of the map.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Introduce fixed elevation range for mesh layers ¶ A new fixed elevation range mode is available for mesh layers, equivalent to the fixed elevation range mode for raster layers which provides a new option for specifying how mesh layers have associated elevation. It permits a fixed elevation range to be set for the layer. It can be used when the layer has a single fixed elevation or a range (slice) of elevation values.\nUsers can set the lower and upper elevation range for the layer, and whether the lower or upper limits are inclusive or exclusive.\nWhen enabled, the layer will only be visible in 2D maps with elevation filtering active if the layer\u0026rsquo;s range is included in the z range of the map.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add a \u0026ldquo;fixed range per band\u0026rdquo; elevation mode for rasters ¶ In this new mode, each band in the raster can have a fixed elevation range associated with it.\nThis is designed for data sources that expose elevation-related data in bands, e.g. a NetCDF raster with temperate data at different ocean depths.\nWhen rendering, the UPPERMOST matching band will be selected and used for the layer\u0026rsquo;s data. The renderer configuration will be retained unchanged regardless of the matching band, so users must configure the rendering options for the layer using a representative range that covers the data from all bands.\nThe layer configuration is exposed as a user-editable table of raster bands with lower and upper values. Users can either populate the lower and upper values manually or use a QGIS Expression to fill all band values automatically.\nExpression-based value definitions will allow users to design expressions capable of extracting useful information from file metadata that might otherwise be difficult to manipulate, such as the band names themselves, e.g. \u0026ldquo;Band 001: depth=-5500 (meters)\u0026rdquo;.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add \u0026ldquo;dynamic elevation range per band\u0026rdquo; mode for rasters ¶ A new dynamic mode for configuration raster elevation is provided where the elevation range for raster bands is calculated using a pair of QGIS Expressions for the lower and the upper limits of the elevation range for the layer.\nIn this mode, the user can specify a QGIS expression for the lower and upper value corresponding to raster bands, using variables like @band, @band_name, and @band_description alongside standard QGIS Expression values, globals, and project variables.\nFor example:\n@band * 100 This can be used when each band represents a 100 m vertical slice of data.\nThe expression will be evaluated when required to determine the actual elevation range corresponding to each band.\nThis differs from the\u0026quot;Fixed Elevation Range Per Band\u0026quot; mode which requires users to manually enter an elevation for each band separately, and these values are then treated as constants. That mode works best for rasters with non-regular steps in the band elevation values, while the dynamic mode is more suitable for data that includes regular elevation steps across each band.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add fixed elevation range per dataset group mode for mesh layers ¶ Additional functionality to set a fixed elevation range per dataset group on mesh layers mimics the new \u0026ldquo;fixed range per band\u0026rdquo; mode raster layers but allows a per-dataset group elevation range to be set for mesh layers.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add option to export all lines with minimal width in dxf exports ¶ An optional setting has been added to dxf exports that will allow users to write all lines with minimal width 0 (hairline).\nLines within DXF files having zero width typically remain minimal in the CAD regardless of zoom level, so this functionality can be quite useful for compatibility with exported DXFs that are edited with other software, especially in use cases where high data density is a concern.\nThis feature was funded by Stadtwerke München\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nFeature: Allow users to override the layer names exported to DXF ¶ It is now possible to override the output name of individual layers exported, with new configuration options added to the DXF export dialogs for project exports, layer exports, and the Export layers to DXF Processing algorithm.\nThis feature was funded by the QGIS user group Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Germán Carrillo\nFeature: Create DXF blocks for point symbols with data defined properties ¶ Additional enhancements have been added to the capability of utilizing references within a DXF, especially for complex data-defined properties, providing much smaller DXF outputs for complex layers that include repeated point symbols.\nA process of attribute hashing is utilized to optimize the performance and account for all possible attribute combinations. In instances where many combinations are unique, each block would only be used nearly once - resulting in a large output file. To manage such cases, the \u0026ldquo;Export Project to DXF\u0026rdquo; dialog now includes new configuration options to limit the number of blocks per symbol layer (-1 means no limitation). If the limit is set to an integer value, e.g. 5, then only the 5 blocks with the highest number of references are created and the other symbols are written inline.\nThis feature was funded by Stadtwerke München\nThis feature was developed by mhugent\nFeature: Add option \u0026lsquo;Use only selected features\u0026rsquo; to DXF export ¶ A new option has been added to DXF export dialogs that will allow users to export only the features active in the current selection.\nBy default, this setting will be set to false.\nThis feature was funded by the QGIS user group Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Germán Carrillo\nFeature: Import/ Export \u0026lsquo;DXF Export\u0026rsquo; dialog settings ¶ Users to save and restore GUI settings for the DXF Export dialog, making it possible to export any number of configurations for improved reusability or to share them with colleagues for enhanced collaboration.\nSettings are exported to an XML file which can be loaded into the DXF Export configuration interface, overwriting the existing configuration values.\nThis feature was funded by the QGIS user group Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Germán Carrillo\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Add CMYK support for Color Widget ¶ CMYK color support has been added for the color widget in line with the CMYK QEP.\nThis feature was funded by Métropôle de Bordeaux\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces\nFeature: Add parent feature scope when adding/editing a child feature through the relation editor widget ¶ A current_parent_* scope is now provided when adding and editing child features through the attribute form\u0026rsquo;s relation editor widget.\nThis is very useful in contexts where a captured feature or value may rely on the parent entity being captured at the same time, but as the parent feature has not yet been captured, the attributes and geometry cannot be retrieved.\nThis feature was funded by Hansestadt Herford\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Add \u0026ldquo;match contains\u0026rdquo; to autocompleter in value relation widget ¶ Previously, the autocomplete function would match from the beginning of the string only, but a new checkbox option allows users to match contained values within the entire string.\nThe old behavior is still the default for autocomplete, making this setting an opt-in operation.\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Implement value relation\u0026rsquo;s grouping functionality ¶ Grouping functionality has been added for the value relation editor widget, allowing users to regroup items into buckets of values. Users are also given the option to show the group value as a group header name in the combo box and table widgets.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nLayer Legend ¶ Feature: Show a color ramp legend for vector heatmap layers ¶ Instead of showing no legend for these layers, QGIS will now show the color ramp as a gradient bar.\nUsers can control the text for the min/ max labels, the direction of the bar, and the font settings.\nThis update also introduced changes to the internal API for vector renderers so that renderers have the flexibility to create other types of legend nodes other than QgsSymbolLegendNodes and provides the opportunity for future extensions to existing renderers.\nThis feature was funded by Rubicon Concierge Real Estate Services\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add layer tree filter for \u0026ldquo;Show Broken Layers Only\u0026rdquo; ¶ When checked, only layers with broken sources will be shown in the tree.\nThis allows users to easily find broken layers in large complex projects, where they may otherwise escape notice!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Show more detail in history dialog ¶ A new tree display is provided for review of processing history entries, where the root item for each entry shows the full algorithm log when clicked and the respective python or qgis_process commands are displayed as child items.\nThis provides more useful information for users browsing the history, while still making all the previous information available.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add \u0026ldquo;Run Selected Steps\u0026rdquo; option to model designer ¶ A new action will allow users to run only the selected steps in a model, effectively allowing users to run a subset of a model.\nThe initial state will be taken from any previous executions of the model through the designer, so results from previous steps in the model are available for the selected steps.\nThis makes it possible for a user to fix parts of a large model, without having to constantly run the entire model to test. Especially\nuseful when earlier steps in the model are time-consuming!\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add \u0026ldquo;View Output Layers\u0026rdquo; option for model child algorithms ¶ When editing a model through the designer, a new right-click context option has been added for \u0026ldquo;View Output Layers\u0026rdquo; on any child step in the model\nthat has been run. Selecting this option will add the output layers from that step as new layers in the current QGIS project.\nThis action is available for all child algorithms in the model, even if the model is not configured to use the outputs from those children as model outputs. This action is also always available after running the model, even if the model itself fails (e.g. because of a misconfigured step later in the model).\nThis is designed as a helpful debugging action. If a user\u0026rsquo;s model fails (or gives unexpected results), they will now be able to trace through the model and view the outputs for suspected problematic steps, avoiding the need to add temporary outputs to a model and re-run for testing purposes.\nAn additional \u0026ldquo;View Log\u0026rdquo; action has also been provided so that users can see the log for each child after the algorithm dialog has been closed down.\nThis feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Endpoint distance threshold for network analysis ¶ An optional end-point distance threshold parameter has been added to the network analysis tools.\nThe previous (and current default) behavior is that endpoints will ALWAYS be snapped to the nearest point in the network layer, regardless of how far away from the network they are, resulting in errors where points are snapped to an edge an arbitrary distance away.\nThe behavior of the threshold depends on the algorithm:\nFor the “Service area (from layer)” tool an optional new output was added for “non-routable features”. This output will contain any features that were deemed too far from the network. All other features that are within tolerance distance to the network will be stored in the standard output from the tool. For the “Service area (from point)” tool an error will be raised if the point is too far from the network For the “Shortest path (point to point)” tool an error will be raised if either the source or destination points are too far from the network. For the “Shortest path (layer to point)” and “Shortest path (point to layer)” tools: An error will be raised if the point is too far from the network. A new optional output was added for “non-routable features”. This output will contain any features that were deemed too far from the network. All other features that are within tolerance distance to the network will be stored in the standard output from the tool. This feature was funded by City of Canning\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add support for pure date and time decorators ¶ QGIS Processing previously provided support for generating and processing datetime values as an explicit datetime type, but this release will support the definition of datetime, time, and date objects as discrete data types.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by Jean Felder\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Add vertical crs option for projects ¶ In line with QEP #267, a new vertical CRS option has been added to projects.\nIf the project CRS is a compound CRS, then the vertical CRS for the project will be the vertical component of the main project CRS. Otherwise, it will be the value explicitly set by the user.\nUsers can specify the vertical CRS through the Elevation Tab of the Project Properties.\nIf a compound CRS is defined as the active CRS for a project, the Vertical Reference System will infer the Vertical CRS definition. If the current project CRS is a 2D/ Horizontal CRS, then users will be able to define their own explicitly selected Vertical CRS.\nThis functionality does not impact rendering or feature handling and is currently a metadata property only.\nThe API for project objects has also been extended to support this functionality, and now includes methods for:\ncrs(): The existing project method for the defined project CRS verticalCrs(): A new project method for fetching the Vertical Reference System crs3D(): An explicit getter for retrieving a compound reference system (combination of crs and verticalCrs) This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add elevation range to project properties ¶ This setting allows users to specify the upper and lower elevation limits associated with the project in line with QEP 201, providing an equivalent user experience for filtering elevation range as users may already be familiar with for configuring the temporal range settings within projects.\nThis can be specified through the Elevation tab (renamed from \u0026ldquo;Terrain\u0026rdquo;) in the Project Properties and extends the API of the QgsProjectElevationProperties class.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nSensors ¶ Feature: Support feature expansion ¶ This change allows SensorThings entities to be expanded to contain their related child feature attributes, exposing the relational SensorThings model as a traditional \u0026ldquo;flat\u0026rdquo; GIS-friendly table structure.\nFor example, when selecting Location entities, users can now opt to expand to \u0026ldquo;Things \u0026gt; Datastreams \u0026gt; Observations\u0026rdquo;. This would result in multiple \u0026ldquo;stacked\u0026rdquo; point location features, one corresponding to each observation, with the attributes for each point feature containing the location, thing, datastream, and observation attributes.\nThis functionality is best used when combined with some extent, feature limit, or custom filter option, as this can otherwise result in very heavy requests to the backend service!\nAn option to limit the number of child features returned when expanding is provided. By default, a conservative amount of features will be returned to reduce the load on services and require users to explicitly \u0026ldquo;opt-in\u0026rdquo; to fetch large amounts of features.\nThis feature was funded by BRGM and Water4All Partnership\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Add support for SensorThings Multidatastreams ¶ This adds support for the Multidatastream entity type, as implemented in the SensorThings version 1.1 \u0026ldquo;MultiDatastream extension\u0026rdquo;.\nWhile the specification mandates that MultiDatastreams have an optional polygon geometry, many servers expose different geometry types for this entity or return errors when attempting to read the geometries from MultiDatastreams. Accordingly, QGIS now exposes an option to load MultiDatastreams as geometryless layers alongside the default option to load them as polygon layers, allowing users to handle a wider range of connections.\nThis feature was funded by BRGM and Water4All Partnership\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Serial port sensor\u0026rsquo;s data frame delimiter ¶ A new data frame delimiter option has been added to the serial port sensor configuration.\nIn cases where multiple data frames are found in the last chunk of data pushed by the serial port, this implementation will return all data frames. Users can then use an expression to further split the returned last data value from the sensor into individual frames (e.g. using string_to_array).\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Add an optional feature limit setting ¶ Allows setting a maximum number of features to request from the service, avoiding overloading services with too many requests\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Implement subset string support for SensorThings ¶ This allows setting custom filters on the layer, using the SensorThings filter syntax.\nA custom layer filter GUI is provided for SensorThings layer filters, making it easier for users to craft valid filters using the SensorThings filter language.\nThis feature was funded by BRGM and Water4All Partnership\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nProfile Plots ¶ Feature: Add tolerance for lines and polygons ¶ The elevation profile tool has been improved by adding tolerance support for lines and polygons (2D/ 3D), as illustrated using drillhole representations (from the OpenLog plugin).\nWithout support for tolerances, any line or polygon feature is displayed in its entirety within the elevation profile plot as soon as it intersects the profile curve. By adding support for user-defined tolerances, only intersecting slices of the feature that fall within the defined region are rendered on the plot.\nThis feature was funded by CEA/DAM François Renard\nThis feature was developed by Benoit D.-M. - oslandia\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Add extent based filtering for SensorThings layers ¶ Allows users to set an extent limit for the layer so that features are only ever loaded within this extent.\nThe extent can be set using the data source manager before initially adding the layer, or modified within the source tab if the layer properties.\nThis feature was funded by BRGM and Water4All Partnership\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Web proxy prefix support for ArcGIS URLs ¶ A new prefix field is provided in ArcGIS settings dialogs that allows users to define the URL prefix of a web proxy used to access ArcGIS Services which will be prepended to all requests.\nThis feature was developed by Vytax\nFeature: Add support for fast extent estimation on SAP HANA connections ¶ Stored extent metadata can be utilized with the new \u0026ldquo;use estimated metadata\u0026rdquo; connection, which allows for precomputed extent estimation and much faster connectivity on large tables.\nAlthough costly aggregation functions are avoided whenever the extent is recomputed, the extent information for HANA tables is only available after a delta merge. By default, this option will leverage a fallback to the standard behavior of using aggregation functions to compute extents in cases where the data is unavailable(or has not yet been computed).\nThis feature was developed by Johannes Quast\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Default limit for GetFeatureInfo results ¶ A new setting allows users to set a default FEATURE_COUNT value individually for each WMS connection, with a predefined default value of 10.\nThis default also works when adding WMS layers from the browser and it can be overridden for each layer when added from the datasource manager.\nThe default user experience has not changed when adding layers from the data source manager, so the default of 10 still applies unless it is explicitly set from the connection settings.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS user group Germany (QGIS Anwendergruppe Deutschland e.V.)\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Add crs information in WMS GetFeatureInfo output when it differs from WGS84 ¶ GeoJSON explicitly requires the use of OGC:CRS84, but when a GetFeatureInfo request that explicitly requests a CRS that is not WGS84 is sent to a QGIS Server WMS, the output will now include the CRS definition in a manner compatible with the older GeoJSON specification format that included support for multiple Coordinate Reference Systems.\nThis feature was funded by Eurométropole de Strasbourg\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: Add replace/ replace all functionality to QgsCodeEditorWidget ¶ The new replace functionality allows replacing matching text. If the regex find option is enabled, then captured groups from the regular expression pattern are available for use in the replacement string using the numeric identifier of the group (e.g. via \\1).\nIn addition, the processing script editor has been ported to leverage the QgsCodeEditorWidget class and functionalities.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Register custom elevation profile sources ¶ We\u0026rsquo;ve added a new QgsProfileSourceRegistry class to allow both core and plugin developers to register profile sources other than map layers (e.g., based on profile web services).\nThese custom profile sources can generate elevation profiles that are displayed in the main Elevation Profile dock widget and as layout items.\nTo do so, plugins should subclass QgsAbstractPluginSource and pass it to the registry via registerProfileSource(). Likewise, plugins should unregister (most likely on their unload() method) their registered sources via unregisterProfileSource().\nLike other QGIS registries, the profile source registry is available from the QgsApplication object: QgsApplication.profileSourceRegistry().\nThis feature was funded by the QGIS user group Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Germán Carrillo\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Even Rouault (Spatialys) ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.34 backport commit (GitHub)\nQGIS cannot load feature classes from a .gdb with a 64bit ObjectID #57471 Probably no longer a bug with GDAL 3.9 QGIS crashes while Export Data from a WFS-Service as DXF-File #57139 Cannot reproduce WFS connection problems after QGIS Update from LTR 3.28.2 to LTR 3.34.4 #56931 Not a QGIS bug [GML] asGml3() creates invalid GML for CurvePolygon #57355 PR #57476 PR #57485 GDAL processing provider: \u0026ldquo;FutureWarning: Neither ogr.UseExceptions() nor ogr.DontUseExceptions() has been explicitly called\u0026rdquo;

QGIS 3.4 just released. After five consolidation point releases (3.4.5) it will replace the previous LTR in the package repositories in February 2019 (see release schedule). This is a giant leap forward for the project - our first Long Term Release based on the 3.x platform. For users moving over from the 2.18 LTR there is a huge list of new features and impactful changes in this new LTR version. Please bear in mind that 3.x plugins are incompatible with 2.x plugins so review your plugin usage carefully - and if possible help to migrate old plugins to the new platform. If you have not already done so, take a look at the changelogs from Version 3.0 and Version 3.2 to understand the full scope of changes in the 3.4 release.\nThanks\nWe would like to thank the developers, documenters, testers and all the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so). From the QGIS community we hope you enjoy this release!

It allows users to install different QGIS versions on linux without having to recompile or use Docker. It is a full package with all libraries included, and it uses its own user profile locations. So you'll need some disk space and new habits working with flatpak, but it rocks!\nThis feature was funded by Aleix Pol\nThis feature was developed by Aleix Pol\nFeature: SVG files can be embedded in projects and symbols ¶ Allows SVG images for symbology, labels, etc to be directly embedded inside a project file (or QML style, or QPT print template!) by encoding the svg as a standard base64 string.\nAdditionally, embeded files can be extracted from projects and symbols and saved back to disk based SVG files.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: OpenCL based acceleration ¶ This feature was funded by QGIS.org\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nExpressions ¶ Feature: New expression functions and variables ¶ Many new expression functions have been added in QGIS 3.4. These include many handy functions for working with and manipulating arrays and maps (dictionary) objects.\njson_to_map: Converts a JSON encoded string value to a map (dictionary) type object map_to_json: Converts a map (dictionary) type object to a JSON encoded string value hstore_to_map: Converts a hstore value to a map (dictionary) type object map_to_hstore: Converts a map (dictionary) type object to a hstore value array_foreach : Loops over an array and executes an expression on each item in the array, returning a new array containing each calculated value array_filter : Filters an array according to an expression raster_value: Returns a value sampled from a raster layer at a specified point to_dms: Converts a numeric value to a Degrees, Minutes, Seconds formatted string to_dm: Converts a numeric value to a Degrees, Minutes formatted string line_substring: Returns the portion of a line (or curve) geometry which falls between the specified start and end distances (measured from the beginning of the line). Z and M values are linearly interpolated from existing values. generate_series(start,stop,step): Creates an array containing a sequence of numbers. Additionally, some new variables have also been made available for use within QGIS expressions:\n@canvas_cursor_point: Contains a point value representing the current position of the mouse cursor within the main map canvas @map_layers: Contains an array of all layers which are visible within the map @map_layer_ids: Contains an array of all layer IDs for layers visible within the map This feature was developed by Etienne Trimaille, Matteo Ghetta, Matthias Kuhn, Mathieu Pellerin, Nyall Dawson\nFeature: Code completion for expression builder ¶ Autocompletion for code in the expression editor.\nVariables, function names and field names are proposed and inserted automatically when writing expressions Function parameters are shown while filling them This feature was funded by OPENGIS.ch\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nMap Tools ¶ Feature: Identify or select features based on existing polygon ¶ Often it is useful to select/identify features that are covered by an existing polygon. For this, users can use \u0026quot;Select Features by Polygon\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Identify Features by Polygon\u0026quot; tools, but it was necessary to manually trace the polygon of interest. This new feature allows user to right click on the map and pick an existing polygon feature at that location from popup menu - that polygon will be used as input for selection or identification.\nThis feature was funded by Leicestershire County Council\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Auto selection of exported files in file manager ¶ Whenever a message bar item links to a created file (e.g. after exporting a layout or map layer), the link will now directly open the folder containing this file within the operating system file browser AND pre-select the created file. It's a super-handy shortcut speeding up file operations after an export from QGIS!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New \u0026quot;Open Directory\u0026quot; option for disabled welcome page projects ¶ This new option in the right-click context menu for disabled entries on the welcome page allows users to open the closest existing path to the original project location in their file manager, to hopefully help them re-locate missing/moved/renamed projects.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: UX Improvements for Temporary Scratch Layers ¶ Temporary Scratch Layers in QGIS can be very handy when a \u0026quot;throw-away\u0026quot; layer is needed, such as when pre-processing data in multiple steps. However, they can be a trap for uniformed users who may not realise that the contents of the layer will be permanently lost when the current QGIS project is closed. Accordingly, a new indicator icon has been added which shows up next to any temporary scratch layers in the layer tree, making it immediately clear which layers are temporary only.\nIt's also much easier to transition these temporary layers to permanent disk-based formats. You can either click the new indicator icon or select \u0026quot;Make Permanent\u0026quot; from the layer context menu. QGIS will then prompt for a location to save the temporary layer to, then replaces it in place (keeping the same layer ID, style, form settings, etc).\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Task manager improvements ¶ The QGIS task manager widget (shown in the status bar whenever a background task is running) now shows an estimated time remaining and completion time for long-running background tasks. This Estimated Time of Arrival is calculated using a simple linear interpolation based on the task's elapsed time and current progress, and allows users to know whether they've only got time to make an instance coffee in the office kitchen or walk round the block for a proper barista made coffee before that long processing task completes...\nAdditionally, QGIS uses the standard operating system progress reporting mechanisms on more platforms and occasions in QGIS 3.4. Some long running tasks (which don't run in the background) such as atlas exports now show their progress via the operating system mechanism, and throw up handy completion notifications.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Hyperlinks to local vector \u0026amp; raster datasets in the information panel ¶ For local vector and raster datasets, the Information tab within the layer properties dialog now features source file path hyperlinks. Upon clicking on the hyperlink, the system's file navigator will open and automatically highlight the dataset.\nThis feature was funded by iMhere Asia\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Style manager improvements ¶ The QGIS Style Manager dialog (which allows users to setup and manage their own libraries of symbols and color ramps) now opens non-modally, so it can now be used alongside the main QGIS window (just like the Layout Manager dialog and Print Layout Designer windows).\nWe've also improved the preview of symbols within the Layer Styling dock, adding a toggle to switch between a large icon view and a detailed list view of symbols. Hovering over symbols (and colors!) now shows a large preview of the symbol. Finally, we've made symbol lists more hi-dpi friendly.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Polished browser panel interface and experience ¶ Tons of work was done for this release to improve the user interface and experience of the browser panel including HiDPI fixes, compressed vector/raster dataset improvements, and a refreshed icon set.\nFunctionality has also been added, including the ability to create a new directory directly from the browser context menu. The browser also now shows a more complete range of options for SQL Server connections, matching those options which were already available for other database connections.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin (iMHere Asia), Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: QML chart and drawings widget ¶ A new type of vector layer form widget for showing graphically appealing and interactive items like charts or technical drawings on the attribute form has been added in QGIS 3.4. The widget sports a flexible configuration, including example templates and expression support.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Project\nThis feature was developed by David Signer and Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Mesh layer styling ¶ Adding datasets to mesh layer from properties panel Information and source panel in properties panel Selection of active dataset (properties or styling panel) Styling of contours/scalars (properties or styling panel) Styling of mesh frame (properties or styling panel) Styling of vector arrows (properties or styling panel) This feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Classify symmetric in graduated renderer ¶ This feature was funded by https://github.com/pierreloicq\nThis feature was developed by https://github.com/pierreloicq\nFeature: Partial QML export and import ¶ When exporting and importing styles to and from .qml files it is now possible to select a subset of sections. This allows to save and restore parts of a layer configuration while omitting others. For example, it's possible to export only the symbology of a layer and when importing this QML style file into a layer, any configuration on the forms and widgets or other properties are unaffected. It is also possible to only handle single sections of a style when using copy/paste.\nThis feature was funded by qwat group\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud (OPENGIS.ch GmbH)\nDigitising ¶ Feature: GPS tracking improvements ¶ QGIS 3.4 extends the inbuilt GPS tracking support, adding \u0026quot;acquisition interval\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;distance threshold\u0026quot; parameters. These options can be used to keep the cursor stationary when the receiver is in static conditions.\nThis feature was funded by Andrea Rossi\nThis feature was developed by Andrea Rossi\nFeature: More angle choices in advanced digitizing dock ¶ Options were added to allowing snapping to 5/10/15/18/22.5 degrees while in construction mode.\nThis feature was funded by lbartoletti\nThis feature was developed by lbartoletti\nFeature: Vertex tool can work on the current layer only ¶ The new vertex is a lot more productive now. It can move vertices of all editable layers at once, which is great to preserve cross layers topology. However in many cases, many of us don't want to modify all layers at once. We added a variation of the vertex map tool just for that.\nThis feature was funded by Oslandia\nThis feature was developed by Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)\nFeature: Add reverse line maptools ¶ A long awaited feature ! No more external plugin or algorithm to reverse a line's direction!\nThis feature was funded by OSLANDIA\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti\nFeature: Geometry Precision ¶ Vector layers have a precision configuration option. The precision defines how accurate the location of nodes should be saved. Each node of new or edited geometries is snapped to a grid of this resolution. While digitizing, the grid is shown to guide the user.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Automatically remove duplicate nodes ¶ When adding or editing geometries on a vector layer, QGIS can automatically remove duplicate nodes from geometries. This option is configurable in the digitizing tab of vector layers.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Check for geometry validity ¶ Each new or edited geometry can be checked for validity if this option is activated. This allows to communicate transparently to a user when there are erroneous geometries produced by the current edit session.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Topology checks while editing ¶ Topology checks can be activated on a layer. On newly added and edited geometries, topology checks can be executed. The checks will be executed, when the layer is saved or upon a click on the topology check button on the geometry validation panel.\nThe following checks are available:\nGaps Overlaps Missing vertices on neighbouring polygons This builds on top of the functionality of the geometry checker plugin which was implemented by Sourcepole.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nData Management ¶ Feature: Translation of QGIS projects ¶ Like QGIS and the plugins, the projects are translated with the Qt translation process. Means, it makes the translation according to a Qt Compiled Translation Source File (.qm file). When the user opens a project, QGIS checks for a .qm file laying in the same folder like the .qgs file, having the same name like the .qgs file and having the language-code as postfix of the users language (the language configured in the QGIS settings). To create the translation, in the project settings, there is an option to generate the .ts file, that can edited by programs like Qt Linguist or Transifex.\nMore information in this blog post\nThis feature was funded by QGIS Usergroup Switzerland and QGEP Project\nThis feature was developed by David Signer (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Switch Attribute Table dock mode on demand ¶ A button has been added to the Attribute Table toolbar for switching between docked and window mode on demand. Previously users had to change an option in the settings dialog and open a new table in order to switch between docked/undocked mode, but that's painful if you decide after a table is already open that you'd like to dock/undock it...!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New locator filter to search across all layers ¶ A new locator filter has been added which allows users to search across all layers in their project, by the layer's display expression.\nThe filter can be activated by using the prefix 'af', or by making it a default search via QGIS options -\u0026gt; Locator -\u0026gt; Features In All Layer. Display expressions are defined in the vector layer properties under the display tab. Individual layers can be marked as not searchable in the Project Properties dialog, under the Data Sources tab.\nThis feature was funded by Opengis.ch\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud\nFeature: Non-removable (required) layers highlighted in layer tree ¶ A new indicator \u0026quot;locked\u0026quot; icon is shown for any layers marked as \u0026quot;required\u0026quot; within the current project. This icon gives users instant feedback that a particular layer cannot be removed from the project.\nRequired layers are configured via the Project Properties dialog, Data Sources tab.\nThis feature was funded by Arpa Piemonte (Dipartimento Tematico Geologia e Dissesto) within ERIKUS project\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting) and Faunalia\nFeature: Append raster layer to an existing Geopackage ¶ When saving a raster layer to GeoPackage database, it's now possible to append the layer to an existing file.\nThis feature was funded by Borys Jurgiel\nThis feature was developed by Borys Jurgiel\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Drill-down (cascading) forms in QGIS Value Relation Widgets ¶ New functions and logic in QGIS \u0026ldquo;Value Relation Widgets\u0026rdquo;, allowing the implementation of complex, dynamic filters within QGIS attribute forms. The functionality can be used to implement \u0026ldquo;drill-down\u0026rdquo; forms within QGIS, where the values available in one field depend on the values of other fields:\nThis feature was funded by QGIS community through crowd-funding\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti (with North Road)\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: 3D map items ¶ This feature allows users to add their 3D map view to the print layout.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS community through crowd-funding\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting\nProcessing ¶ Feature: New \u0026quot;Edit in place\u0026quot; mode ¶ Thanks to a large number of generous backers, a crowdfunded \u0026quot;edit in place\u0026quot; mode was added to Processing for 3.4. When a vector layer is active and editable, this mode allows users to execute suitable algorithms directly on the features from the layer, modifying their attributes and geometries in-place. All edits are added to the layer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;edit buffer\u0026rdquo;, so you can easily undo and redo the changes before saving them back to the data source.\nFor those power users who perform frequent data edits, this functionality is also exposed via QGIS 3.0\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Locator bar\u0026rdquo; (that \u0026ldquo;type to locate\u0026rdquo; bar which sits in the bottom-left corner). Typing \u0026rsquo;ef\u0026rsquo; (\u0026ldquo;edit features\u0026rdquo;) followed by the name of the corresponding operation allows you to perform the edits directly via the keyboard. E.g.\nSelect a bunch of line features Press Ctrl + K (activates the locator bar) Type \u0026ldquo;ef reverse\u0026rdquo; Press enter \u0026ndash; the selected line features will be reversed immediately! This feature was funded by Crowdfunding campaign\nThis feature was developed by North Road\nFeature: Store models inside project ¶ Some Processing models are so intrinsically linked to the logic inside a particular project that they have no meaning (or are totally broken) outside of that project (e.g. models which rely on the presence of particular map layers, relations, etc). Accordingly, from QGIS 3.4, Processing models can be stored inside QGIS project files. Any models stored within a project are made available as soon as that project is opened. This also avoids cluttering up the \u0026quot;global\u0026quot; model provider with models which make no sense, and makes it easier to distribute a single project all relevant models included.\nModels are stored inside projects by clicking the new \u0026quot;Embed in Project\u0026quot; button in the Modeler dialog toolbar. Models can be removed from a project from the model's right click menu in the toolbox.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Sample Raster Values ¶ A new algorithm was added for sampling raster layer values at point locations.\nThis feature was funded by Faunalia\nThis feature was developed by Matteo Ghetta (Faunalia)\nFeature: New 'Raster pixels to polygons' algorithm ¶ This algorithm converts a raster layer into a vector layer, with a polygon feature corresponding to each pixel from the raster and a single field containing the band value from the raster.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: K Means clustering algorithm ¶ QGIS 3.4 adds a native \u0026quot;k-means clustering\u0026quot; algorithm. Based on a port of PostGIS' ST_ClusterKMeans function, this algorithm adds a new cluster ID field to a set of input features which identifies the feature's cluster based on a k-means clustering approach. If non-point geometries are used as input, the clustering is based off the centroid of the input geometries.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: dbscan spatial clustering algorithm ¶ This new native algorithm implements an optimised DBSCAN density based scanning cluster approach for clustering 2d point features.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved algorithms ¶ Some miscellaneous improvements to existing Processing algorithms include:\nThe Reverse line direction algorithm now works with MultiLineString geometry inputs Extend lines: support for dynamic (data defined) start and end distances was added Offset lines: support for dynamic offset distance was added The Join by Field Value and Join by Location algorithms can now optionally export unmatched records Join by Field Value also reports counts of matched/unmatched features This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Filter Vertices by M and Filter Vertices by Z algorithms ¶ Two new algorithms were added for filtering line/polygon vertices by their M or Z values. A minimum and maximum M/Z value can be entered, and if the vertices fall outside these ranges they will be discarded from the output geometry. Both the minimum and maximum filter values can also be data defined, so can vary per feature.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: \u0026quot;Array of Translated Features\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ This new algorithm creates copies of features in a layer, by creating multiple translated (offset) versions of the feature. Each copy is displaced by a preset amount in the x/y/z/m axis.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: \u0026quot;Array of offset (parallel) lines\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ This new algorithm creates copies of line features in a layer, by creating multiple parallel versions of each feature. Each copy is offset by a preset distance.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Choice of units for non degree/unknown distances ¶ When an algorithm has a distance parameter in meters/feet/etc (i.e. non-geographic distances), a combo box has been added allowing choice of the unit type.\n(QGIS doesn't (and should never) expose this for distances in degrees -- it's up to users in this situation to choose a suitable local projection and reproject their data to match.)\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson\nFeature: \u0026quot;Drape features to z/m\u0026quot; algorithms ¶ These two new algorithms can set geometry vertex z or m values to values sampled from a raster band. Values can optionally be scaled using a (data definable) scale value.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: \u0026quot;Raster pixels to points\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ A new \u0026quot;pixels to points\u0026quot; algorithm was added in QGIS 3.4, which creates a point feature at the center of every pixel. nodata pixels are skipped.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Line substring algorithm ¶ This new, much-requested, algorithm returns the portion of a line (or curve) which falls between the specified start and end distances (measured from the beginning of the line). Z and M values are linearly interpolated from existing values.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: \u0026quot;Interpolate point on line\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ This new algorithm creates a point geometry interpolated at a set distance along line (or polygon boundary) geometries. Curved input geometries are fully supported. Z or M values are linearly interpolated based on existing values.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: k-neighbour concave hull ¶ This feature was funded by https://qgis.org\nThis feature was developed by Detlev Neumann, Rudi von Staden\nFeature: Python scripts which implement algorithms now execute the algorithm on drag and drop and browser double click ¶ When appropriate, scripts will now launch a processing algorithm dialog upon:\nDragging and dropping a Python script onto the main window Using the browser panel's right-click run script action This feature was funded by iMhere Asia\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: New GDAL's rearrange band algorithm ¶ A new GDAL provider 'Rearrange band' algorithm was added to the processing toolbox. The algorithm allows to output rasters continuing a subset of a given input raster's bands, and offers the possibility to re-order the bands.\nThis feature was funded by iMHere Asia\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: \u0026quot;Precalculated\u0026quot; values for model algorithm parameters ¶ A new option is present for all parameters of using a \u0026quot;precalculated expression\u0026quot;. This expression is evaluated once before the child algorithm is executed and used during the execution of that algorithm.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: \u0026quot;Categorize a layer using a style XML file\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ This new algorithm sets a vector layer's renderer to a categorized renderer using matching symbols from a style database.\nA specified expression (or field name) is used to create categories for the renderer, with QGIS creating a category for each unique value within the layer. Each category is individually matched to the symbols which exist within the specified QGIS XML style database. Whenever a matching symbol name is found, the category's symbol will be set to this matched symbol.\nThe matching is case-insensitive by default, but can be made case-sensitive if required. Optionally, non-alphanumeric characters in both the category value and symbol name can be ignored while performing the match. This allows for greater tolerance when matching categories to symbols.\nIf desired, tables can also be output containing lists of the categories which could not be matched to symbols, and symbols which were not matched to categories.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New mode for Snap geometries algorithm ¶ The new mode \u0026quot;Snap to anchor nodes (single layer only)\u0026quot; makes sure that any two vertices of the vector layer are at least at distance given by the threshold value.\nThis algorithm comes handy when doing vector overlay operations such as intersection, union or difference to prevent possible topological errors caused by numerical errors if coordinates are very close to each other. After running the algorithm some previously valid geometries may become invalid and therefore it may be useful to run Fix geometries algorithm afterwards.\nThis feature was funded by InaSAFE DFAT\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nData Providers ¶ Feature: OAuth2 authentication method plugin ¶ Supports authentication code, implicit and resource owner grant flows Allows for preconfigured connections, read from default locations Offers caching of access token beyond QGIS restarts Save/load configurations This feature was funded by Monsanto Company\nThis feature was developed by Larry Shaffer, Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Mesh layer: New mesh layer format support ¶ Mesh layers represent data on variable size grid with extra components (e.g. time and vector). With introduction of MDAL, users can load the following formats directly in QGIS and explore all other components:\nGRIB XMDF Netcdf This feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting\nFeature: Mesh layer: add function to identify value on mesh layers ¶ With this API, developers can inspect mesh elements and fetch values spatially and temporally. As an example, you can create time series plot from your mesh layer.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting\nFeature: Mesh layer: allow to choose different vector and scalar dataset ¶ A mesh layer often contains several quantities. For example a netcdf/grib can contain several meteorological quantities. Each quantity can also have multiple components. For example, wind data can contain speed (scalar) and values (grid). With this option, you can overlay scalar and grids from different quantities. In the image below, you can see temperature (grid) and wind (scalar).\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting\nFeature: Mesh layer: allow render vectors/arrows on the user-defined grid ¶ Scalar data are generated usually at the centre/corner of each mesh element. When displaying the scalar data, the arrows might look sparse and often not possible to see the general trend. With this option, arrows can be displayed on a user-defined grid. Extra scalar values will be interpolated on-the-fly and placed on the user-defined grid.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting\nFeature: JSON/JSONB Type support ¶ The reading of PostgreSQL JSON types is supported. JSON Data can be displayed in the widgets as \u0026quot;Key/Value\u0026quot; (maps), as \u0026quot;List\u0026quot; (arrays) or as text.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Solothurn\nThis feature was developed by David Signer (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: ESRI Token Authentication support ¶ Support has been added to QGIS' Authentication system for ESRI's temporary token based authentication. This allows for connection to ArcGIS Feature and Map Servers via an allocated temporary token.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: SQL Server - Invalid geometry handling ¶ Recent versions of QGIS have switched to a safer approach to reading SQL Server layers, which automatically checks for geometry validity and repairs geometries when needed. This workaround is required to avoid issues with the design of SQL Server's geometry handling, where encountering any rows with invalid geometries can silently abort a request without returning all the features from a layer. Unfortunately, the workaround comes at a significant performance cost.\nIn QGIS 3.4 a new setting was added to allow users to manually turn off QGIS' SQL Server invalid geometry handling. Turning on the \u0026quot;Skip invalid geometry handling\u0026quot; setting under a SQL Server connection's properties causes QGIS to skip all the expensive geometry validation processing, but firmly places the responsibility for ensuring that all features on the database have valid geometries back upon the user/database administrator. This is a \u0026quot;use at your own risk\u0026quot; setting. Improperly enabling this option can lead to missing features and data loss.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Server Cache can be manage by plugins ¶ By default, QGIS Server only caches WMS GetCapabilities document in memory. With WMTS implementation, it is necessary to have a way to cache tiles. But the cache manager has not been developed to only cache tiles.\nThe cache manager plugin can be used to cache:\nWMS, WFS, WCS, WMTS GetCapabilities documents WFS DescribeFeatureType documents WCS DescribeCoverage documents WMTS GetTile images WMS GetLegendGraphic images Here is a python cache manager class, which do not verify if the QGIS project has changed:\nclass PyServerCache(QgsServerCacheFilter): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Used to have cache control \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; def __init__(self, server_iface): super(QgsServerCacheFilter, self).__init__(server_iface) self._cache_dir = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), \u0026quot;qgs_server_cache\u0026quot;) if not os.path.exists(self._cache_dir): os.mkdir(self._cache_dir) self._tile_cache_dir = os.path.join(self._cache_dir, 'tiles') if not os.path.exists(self._tile_cache_dir): os.mkdir(self._tile_cache_dir) def getCachedDocument(self, project, request, key): m = hashlib.md5() paramMap = request.parameters() urlParam = \u0026quot;\u0026amp;\u0026quot;.join([\u0026quot;%s=%s\u0026quot; % (k, paramMap[k]) for k in paramMap.keys()]) m.update(urlParam.encode('utf8')) if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(self._cache_dir, m.hexdigest() + \u0026quot;.xml\u0026quot;)): return QByteArray() doc = QDomDocument(m.hexdigest() + \u0026quot;.xml\u0026quot;) with open(os.path.join(self._cache_dir, m.hexdigest() + \u0026quot;.xml\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;r\u0026quot;) as f: statusOK, errorStr, errorLine, errorColumn = doc.setContent(f.read(), True) if not statusOK: print(\u0026quot;Could not read or find the contents document.

This is done by setting the QGIS_SERVER_LOG_FILE env var to the special value \u0026quot;stderr\u0026quot;.\nThis feature was funded by OSLANDIA\nThis feature was developed by Eric Lemoine\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Support for encrypted zips in the Plugin Manager ¶ Plugin Manager is now able to install plugins from local zip files even if encrypted.\nThis feature was funded by Borys Jurgiel\nThis feature was developed by Borys Jurgiel\nFeature: Offline Editing GeoPackage ¶ With the offline editing functionality it is possible to select whether the export should create a SpatiaLite or a GeoPackage file for offline usage.\nThis feature was funded by Oester Messtechnik\nThis feature was developed by David Signer (OPENGIS.ch)\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: QgsSpatialIndexKDBush ¶ A very fast static spatial index for 2D points based on a flat KD-tree, using https://github.com/mourner/kdbush.hpp\nCompared to QgsSpatialIndex, this index: - supports single point features only (no multipoints) - is static (features cannot be added or removed from the index after construction) - is much faster! - supports true \u0026quot;distance based\u0026quot; searches, i.e. return all points within a radius from a search point\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: QgsRasterDataProvider::sample method for efficient sampling of rasters at a given point ¶ This is an alternative to the QgsRasterDataProvider::identify method, which is less efficient but more powerful\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New geometry API call to return a curve substring ¶ New PyQGIS API has been added to make it easy to retrieve a substring from a LineString/Curve geometry:\nQgsCurve::curveSubstring - Returns a new curve representing a substring of a curve, from a start distance and end distance.\nIf z or m values are present, the output z and m will be interpolated using the existing vertices' z or m values. The method also handles curved geometries without loss or segmentation.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: sip Module API Changes ¶ Due to upstream changes within the PyQt/sip library, the recommended way to import this module has changed in QGIS 3.4. For maximum portability, instead of directly calling: import sip plugins should instead use: from qgis.PyQt import sip Using this newer style import will ensure that the code works correct across all platforms and remains functional in future QGIS versions.\nFeature: Python vector data providers ¶ Development of the API, a sample provider and tests allowing the creation of vector data provider in pure python.\nThis feature was funded by Good will\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Improved navigation ¶ This will update camera's view center as the camera moves around. Before the view center would be always at the zero elevation, which means that with terrain further away from zero elevation tilting and rotation of camera would feel weird due to the center point being far away.\nAllow moving camera up/down using page up/down keys\nMove camera keeping the position with Ctrl + arrow keys / mouse\nThis feature was funded by QGIS community through crowd-funding\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Animation ¶ You can create an animation based on a set of keyframes - camera positions at particular times. QGIS 3D then interpolates the camera positions/rotations in between the keyframes.\nTo create the keyframes, first set the scene for your map, by rotating, zooming or moving the camera. Then assign a time to the frame. There are several methods for interpolations between keyframes.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS community through crowd-funding\nThis feature was developed by Martian Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Simple rendering of 3D linestrings ¶ This mode of 3D line rendering will use OpenGL line rendering instead of buffering lines into polygons and rendering them as meshes.\nThe advantage is that the 3D lines do not loose their Z coordinate which is the case currently with \u0026quot;ordinary\u0026quot; 3D rendering after buffering.\nThe disadvantage is that the lines cannot be wide (supported in Qt3D only since 5.10, but even then their rendering won't have nice joins/caps) and only ambient color is used from the material.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Identification map tool for 3D views ¶ A new Identify Tool was introduced to 3D map. Using this tool, you can inspect features from the 3D scene.\nThis feature was funded by Department of Environment, Land and Infrastructure Engineering (DIATI)\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting) and Faunalia\nFeature: Experimental Python API ¶ Some classes from QGIS 3D have been made available for Python developers. It is now possible to query or change 3D renderers of map layers and read/write properties of contained 3D symbols such as material colors. Please note that for now the API is considered as experimental, so it may change in future 3.x releases.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog34/","tags":null,"title":"Changelog for QGIS 3.4 LTR"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Changelog for QGIS 3.6 ¶ Release date: 2019-02-22\nThe greatest QGIS release ever!

The decorator features a background bar with customizable color and opacity.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Top/bottom centering placement for decoration items ¶ Map canvas copyright and the newly-added title decorations can now be centered at the top or bottom of the map view.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Vertex tool fixes and improvements ¶ Note: all the items mentioned below have been backported to LTR so they will also appear in QGIS 3.4.5.\nSelect (\u0026quot;lock\u0026quot;) feature before editing ¶ In QGIS 2.18 you always had to select a feature first before editing it. In QGIS 3 there was no such thing - editing would be done on any feature any time. Now we are making the selection of feature (\u0026quot;lock\u0026quot;) available again - using right click.\nIn earlier QGIS 3 versions, right click on a feature would bring up a small popup menu that offers display of vertex editor. Now, right click on a feature will immediately show the vertex editor and disable editing of any other features.\nWhen a feature is \u0026quot;locked\u0026quot;, it can be again unlocked by clicking on it or by clicking on an empty area - this will bring us back to the default mode when multiple features can be edited.\nWhen there are multiple features in one mouse location, repeated right clicks will loop over them - with every right click you will lock to a different feature. Finally when all features have been offered, no feature will be locked and further right clicks will start the loop again.\nThe locking is possible when clicking a feature's vertex, edge or interior (for polygons).\nAdd new vertex without moving it ¶ It is now possible to use Shift + double click to add a new vertex without placing it to a new location. Sometimes this is useful when users want to add extra vertices on the existing segments.\n\u0026quot;Current layer\u0026quot; mode is now the default ¶ From the two modes of vertex tool, \u0026quot;all layers\u0026quot; used to be the default one. But from the user feedback that seemed like less common case and users prefer to have \u0026quot;current layer\u0026quot; as the default.\nThis feature was funded by German QGIS user group\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Trim/Extend ¶ Unlike a number of software, the tool allows you to modify (multi)lines AND (multi)polygons. Moreover, it is not necessarily the end of the lines that is concerned; any segment of a geometry can be modified. The other side is that this can lead to invalid geometries, it is the responsibility of the user.\nThe tool asks you to select a limit (a segment) on which another segment will be extended or trimmed. Unlike the node tool, a check is performed to modify only the layer being edited.\nWhen both segments are in 3D, the tool performs an interpolation on the limit segment to return the Z.\nIn the case of a trim, you must select the part that will be shortened by clicking on it.\nThis feature was funded by Mairie de Megève\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti (Oslandia)\nFeature: Rectangle from 3 points (projected) ¶ There is already a method to make rectangle by 3 points where the rectangle takes a length between the first and second point and the second length is equal to the distance between the 3rd and 2nd point.\nThis new method allows to create a rectangle by 3 points where the second length is the distance between the point and the point projected perpendicularly on the segment (or its extension).\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti (Oslandia)\nFeature: Identify tool for mesh layers ¶ The identify tool now works on the mesh layer. It displays the value of scalar and vector components of the mesh at the current time.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nExpressions ¶ Feature: New Expression Functions ¶ force_rhr: forces polygons to follow the right hand rule, in which the area that is bounded by a polygon is to the right of the boundary. In particular, the exterior ring is oriented in a clockwise direction and the interior rings in a counter-clockwise direction. decode_uri: takes a layer parameter and an optional uri part parameter. It will return details about the data source of the layer. The available details depend on the data provider. If called with only a layer parameter, a map will be returned with all the available information. If the part is also specified, only the value for the requested part will be extracted from the map. path has been added as an option for the layer_property expression function array_sort: sorts an array of elements nullif sqlite_fetch_and_increment make_rectangle_3points: Make a rectangle from 3 points. There is two options for make the rectangle by the distance or a projection. Option distance: Second distance is equal to the distance between 2nd and 3rd point. Option projected: Second distance is equal to the distance of the perpendicular projection of the 3rd point on the segment or its extension. make_square: Creates a square from a diagonal. from_json to_json Feature: Square brackets to easily access map array elements ¶ Allows expressions like:\narray(1,2,3)[0] -\u0026gt; 1 array(1,2,3)[2] -\u0026gt; 3 array(1,2,3)[-1] -\u0026gt; 3 (Python style, negative indices count from end of array) array(1,2,3)[-3] -\u0026gt; 1 map('a',1,'b',2)['a'] -\u0026gt; 1 map('a',1,'b',2)['b'] -\u0026gt; 2 This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson, Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: New map expression variables ¶ @map_crs_description: name of the coordinate reference system of the map. @map_crs_acronym: acronym of the coordinate reference system of the map. @map_ellipsoid_acr: acronym of the ellipsoid of the coordinate reference system of the map. @map_crs_proj4: Proj4 definition of the coordinate reference system. @map_crs_wkt: WKT definition of the coordinate reference system. This feature was developed by Alexis Roy-Lizotte\nFeature: New try() function to catch errors ¶ The new try() function tries an expression and returns its value if error-free. If the expression returns an error, an alternative value will be returned when provided otherwise the function will return null.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: A new grayscale theme: \u0026quot;Blend of Gray\u0026quot; ¶ A brand new UI theme has made its way into QGIS named \u0026quot;Blend of Gray\u0026quot;. In addition, hundreds of fixes, tweaks, and refinements were applied to the preexisting \u0026quot;Night Mapping\u0026quot; theme.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Multiline selections and editing in code/expression editors ¶ Holding ctrl while selecting in the QGIS expressions and Python script editors allows you to select a multi-line block of text, which can be edited all at once.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson ()\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Better handling of .XML style libraries ¶ The browser panel now shows QGIS style xml libraries, and these files can also be drag and dropped to a QGIS window. This opens a dialog allowing users to explore the style library, and import styles from the library to their QGIS install.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Optionally force right-hand-rule during polygon symbol rendering ¶ This new option, available under the \u0026quot;Advanced\u0026quot; button for fill symbols, allows forcing rendered polygons to follow the standard \u0026quot;right hand rule\u0026quot; for ring orientation (where exterior ring is clockwise, and interior rings are all counter-clockwise).\nThe orientation fix is applied while rendering only, and the original feature geometry is unchanged.\nThis allows for creation of fill symbols with consistent appearance, regardless of the dataset being rendered and the ring orientation of individual features.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS User Group Germany\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Option for simple lines and marker lines to only render exterior ring or interior rings ¶ This new option is shown whenever a simple line symbol or marker line symbol is used as part of a fill symbol for rendering polygons. The default behavior is to render both interior and exterior rings, but this new setting allows users to set the symbol layer to render only for the exterior ring OR only for interior rings. This allows for symbolisation which wasn't directly possible before, such as a marker line with markers for interior rings angled toward the interior of the polygon.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS User Group Germany\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Raster image marker ¶ A new raster image marker symbology type was added to QGIS allowing users to use a raster, i.e. bitmap, image file to display as a marker. The raster image marker symbology permits customization of width, height, image ratio, rotation, and opacity.\nUsing data-defined image source, this new symbology makes for a great method to display georeferenced images on a map canvas.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Raster fill can have images set to remote URLs or embedded images ¶ Just like the SVG and raster image marker, raster fill can now be set to use HTTP(s) URLs or have files directly embedded inside the symbol itself.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Use represention values for classified renderers ¶ When a field is configured with a value relation, value map or other \u0026quot;representable value\u0026quot; and the field is used as the source for a classification renderer, the represented values will be taken to label the categories.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn\nFeature: Option to merge categories in categorized renderer ¶ This change allows users to select multiple existing categories and group them into a single category, which applies to any of the values from the selection.\nThis allows simpler styling of layers with a large number of categories, where it may be possible to group numerous distinct categories into a smaller, more managable set of categories which apply to multiple values.\nThe option is available from the right click context menu in the categories list view, whenever multiple categories are selected.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Show Project Colors in color bound data defined buttons ¶ This adds a new \u0026quot;Project Colors\u0026quot; section in data defined buttons which are linked to a color value. The color menu contains all colors defined as part of the current project's Project Color Scheme (which is defined through project properties).\nWhen a project color is selected from the button, the property becomes linked to that color. It will automatically follow any future changes to the color when made through project properties.\nThis allows users to define common colors for a project once, and then \u0026quot;bind\u0026quot; symbol, label, layout, etc colors to these preset colors. The link is live, so you change it once, and the change is reflected EVERYWHERE. Sure beats updating a color 100 times when it's use has been scattered throughout a project's symbols, labels, etc...\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Style manager dialog improvements ¶ The Style Manager dialog has seen a number of improvements:\nA new \u0026quot;list view\u0026quot; mode has been added An \u0026quot;all\u0026quot; tab has been added, which shows all matching symbols (regardless of the symbol type) This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: SLD export for raster styles ¶ QGIS is now able to export raster styling to sld, for example to be used in Geoserver. See: https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/styling/qgis/index.html#exporting-raster-symbology\nThis feature was funded by OSGeo UK, GeoServer PSC, Brad Hards\nThis feature was developed by Luigi Pirelli and GeoSolutions\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Georeferencer enhancements ¶ add dX, dY and residual on GCP Points add option to automatically save GCP Points in the raster-modified path This feature was developed by Faneva Andriamiadantsoa\nFeature: New option to avoid minimizing georeferencer when adding points ¶ Users can now choose to avoid the automatic georeferencer window minimisation which occurs when adding new control points from the map canvas. This behaviour can be annoying on multi-monitor setups where it can be desirable to have both windows visible while adding points.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nData Management ¶ Feature: Comment option in db manager ¶ This feature was developed by Corentin Falcone (SIRS)\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: New form widget for binary (blob) fields ¶ This widget is available for binary fields only (and is the default widget used for binary fields). It offers a label showing whether the blob field is empty or not, and if non-empty shows the content size (in bytes/kb/etc).\nA drop down menu button allows users to save the current binary contents of the field out to a disk based file, clear the contents of a blob field, or embed binary contents by picking a file from their system.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nMap Composer ¶ Feature: Grid frame improvements ¶ Users can now set a margin for the grid frames in layout map items. Additionally, new \u0026quot;Zebra (Nautical)\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Line border (Nautical)\u0026quot; frame styles have been added, which show nautical-style blocks in the grid corners when a margin is set for the grid.\nThis feature was developed by konst\nFeature: Improved handling of text and label export ¶ When exporting a print layout to PDF or SVG formats, users are now given a choice of how text and labels within that layout should be exported. Available options are to convert all text for outlines/curves (the previous default), or to leave text and labels as text objects.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Map labeling improvements ¶ Several improvements have been made regarding how labels are rendered within layout map items.\nA new setting allows per-map control of how close labels are permitted to be placed to the map item's edges. Sizes can be set using mm/inches/pixels/etc, and data defined label margins are allowed. A new setting allows per-map control of whether partial labels are visible in the map. This defaults to off, (unlike the canvas setting, which defaults to true for a new project) as layouts should always default to the settings which produce the highest quality cartographic outputs. This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Rework of map item extent/scale shortcuts ¶ The buttons for setting layout map items to match the current map view (and vice versa) have been moved up to a new toolbar in map item properties windows.\nNew actions have also been added to set the map item's scale to match the main canvas scale, and to set the main canvas scale to match the selected layout map's scale. These mirror the existing settings for setting the extent from the canvas and pushing the extent TO the canvas.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Layout items can \u0026quot;block\u0026quot; map labels ¶ This feature allows other layout items (such as scalebars, north arrows, inset maps, etc) to be marked as \u0026quot;blockers\u0026quot; for the map labels in a map item. This prevents any map labels from being placed under those items - causing the labeling engine to either try alternative placement for these labels (or discarding them altogether).\nThis allows for more cartographically pleasing maps -- placing labels under other items can make them hard to read, yet without this new setting it's non-trivial to get QGIS to avoid placing the labels in these obscured areas.\nThe blocking items are set through a map item's properties, under the label settings panel. The setting is per-map item, so you can have a scalebar block the labels for one map in your layout and not others (if you so desire!)\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Warnings on exports ¶ When exporting print layouts, QGIS now automatically checks the layout for common mistakes and warns users when they are found:\nScalebars not linked to a map item Picture items with broken or missing paths, or linked to unreadable image files Map overviews no longer linked to a valid map item This feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Control over stacking position of map overview extents ¶ QGIS allows overview extents to be drawn below map labels (the new default), but in 3.6 choices have been added for drawing them below all map layers, or above/below a specific map layer. This allows users to control exactly where in the map item's layer stack the overview will be placed, e.g. allowing them to draw a overview extent below some feature layers such as roads whilst drawing it above other background layers.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New expression variables for legend items ¶ New expression variables have been added for use in data defined expressions in layout legend items, including:\n@legend_title @legend_column_count @legend_split_layers @legend_wrap_string @legend_filter_by_map @legend_filter_out_atlas If the legend is linked to a map, then expressions used in that legend will also have access to the linked variables, including @map_scale, @map_extent, etc.\nAdditionally, symbols rendered as part of a legend now use the full available expression context for the legend. This means the symbols will have access to variables like the current atlas feature.\nThis feature was developed by Alexis Roy-Lizotte\nFeature: Expressions inside legend item text ¶ This feature allows for expressions to be embedded directly inside legend item text (e.g. group, subgroup and item text). The expressions are evaluated at render time, with full knowledge of the legend's expression context (so can utilise variables from the layout/layout item/etc)\nThere's no UI for this yet (that will come in 3.8), but expressions are entered using the standard [% 1 + 2 %] format.\nE.g. a legend item text of\nMy layer (rendered at 1:[% @map_scale %]) will show in the output as\nMy layer (rendered at 1:1000) This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nAnalysis Tools ¶ Feature: Hardware acceleration for raster calculator ¶ OpenCL acceleration is now available by default for raster calculator operations.\nThis feature was funded by Alessandro Pasotti - ItOpen\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Mesh calculator ¶ Similar to raster calculator, mesh calculator works on mesh layers. In addition to the general functions, mesh calculator also provides time aggregate functions. For example, if you have a netcdf with daily temperature over a month, you can calculate the average temperature for the whole month for each cell. The output can be filtered by time span or spatial extent.\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nProcessing ¶ Feature: New algorithm \u0026quot;Remove duplicates by attribute\u0026quot; ¶ Allows for removal of duplicate features, identified using the values in one (or more) field values from the input features. Optionally any discarded (duplicate) features can be saved to a separate sink.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Explode HStore algorithm ¶ This algorithm creates a copy of an input layer and adds a new field for every unique key found in a HStore type field. For instance, a HStore field is often present in an OSM dataset (\u0026quot;other_tags\u0026quot;).\nThis feature was developed by Etienne Trimaille\nFeature: Force right-hand-rule ¶ This new algorithm forces polygon geometries to respect the Right-Hand-Rule, in which the area that is bounded by a polygon is to the right of the boundary. In particular, the exterior ring is oriented in a clockwise direction and the interior rings in a counter-clockwise direction.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS User Group Germany\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Extract Binary Field algorithm ¶ This new algorithm allows users to extract binary fields to files.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Split Lines by Maximum Length algorithm ¶ This algorithm takes an input (multi)line (or curve) layer, and splits each feature into multiple parts such that no part is longer then the specified maximum length.\nSupports data-defined maximum length property, and edit in place operation.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson, Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: New parameter type for authentication config ¶ A new parameter type for processing algorithms, QgsProcessingParameterAuthConfig, has been added, allowing selection from available authentication configurations (and creation of new ones).\nIt allows creation of processing algorithm which can fully take advantage of QGIS' mature authentication handling, avoiding the need to use insecure string parameters for users to input sensitive logon credentials.\nQgsProcessingParameterAuthConfig parameters are evaluated using QgsProcessingAlgorithm.parameterAsString(), which returns the selected authentication configuration ID.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: resampling and format options in the gdaladdo algorithm ¶ This feature was developed by Alex Bruy\nFeature: Raster zonal stats algorithm ¶ This algorithm calculates statistics for a raster layer's values, categorized by zones defined in another raster layer.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Extract Z values and Extract M values algorithms ¶ These algorithms allow users to convert z or m values present in feature geometries to attributes in the layer.\nBy default the z/m value from the first vertex in the feature is extracted, but optionally statistics can be calculated on ALL the z/m values from the geometry (e.g. calculating mean/min/max/sum/etc of z values).\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Geodesic line split at antimeridian algorithm ¶ This algorithm splits a line into multiple geodesic segments, whenever the line crosses the antimeridian (±180 degrees longitude). Splitting at the antimeridian helps the visual display of the lines in some projections. The returned geometry will always be a multi-part geometry.\nWhenever line segments in the input geometry cross the antimeridian, they will be split into two segments, with the latitude of the breakpoint being determined using a geodesic line connecting the points either side of this segment. The current project ellipsoid setting will be used when calculating this breakpoint.\nIf the input geometry contains M or Z values, these will be linearly interpolated for the new vertices created at the antimeridian.\nSupports in-place edit mode also.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Geodesic mode for \u0026quot;Join by Lines (Hub lines)\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ This allows optional creation of geodesic lines, which represent the shortest distance between the points based on the ellipsoid.\nWhen geodesic mode is used, it is possible to split the created lines at the antimeridian (±180 degrees longitude), which can improve rendering of the lines. Additionally, the distance between vertices can be specified. A smaller distance results in a denser, more accurate line.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Raster Surface Volume algorithm ¶ The SAGA raster surface volume has been ported to a native QGIS algorithm. The SAGA version of this algorithm is of limited use in QGIS, because the volume calculated is embedded only in the SAGA terminal output. This prevents it being saved to a file, or reused within a model as an input to a later model step. Accordingly, the algorithm has been ported across to a native QGIS c++ algorithm. The algorithm duplicates the SAGA algorithm 1:1, but outputs the volume (and area) to either a HTML report, or a vector table. Additionally, the outputs are exported as numeric outputs from the algorithm, allowing them to be re-used within models.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Resurrected model to Python script functionality ¶ The 2.x ability to directly convert a Processing model to an equivalent Python script has been resurrected and updated for the 3.x Processing API.\nThis feature was funded by Solspec\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nApplication and Project Options ¶ Feature: Delete settings from the Advanced tab in options ¶ This change adds a new right click menu to the settings shown in the \u0026quot;Advanced\u0026quot; tab in the settings dialog, which allows users to remove that setting (or group of settings).\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Add \u0026quot;export to file\u0026quot; options for raster and vector layers within the browser ¶ Allows for direct export of these files (e.g. to a different format, crs, etc) without having to actually load them into a project first.\nThis feature was funded by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Native file/folder properties ¶ You can now right click on a file or folder within the browser, and select \u0026quot;File Properties\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Directory Properties\u0026quot; to open the native file/folder properties dialog for that entry. This allows rapid access to operating system file or folder properties, such as file permissions and sharing options.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Preview layers and attributes ¶ QGIS 3.6 brings back the functionality from the old 2.18 standalone \u0026quot;browser\u0026quot; application to preview layers and their attributes. This functionality has been moved to the inbuilt browser panel, and is available by right-clicking on a layer and selecting \u0026quot;properties\u0026quot; (or by clicking the \u0026quot;enable properties widget\u0026quot; button in the browser toolbar).\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Explore QGS/QGZ project files in the browser ¶ Previous versions of QGIS would show QGS/QGZ project files in the browser, allowing them to be opened as the new active project. In QGIS 3.6 this functionality has been extended, and project files can now be explored directly WITHIN the browser. Projects are now expandable items, and expanding them shows the full project structure of groups and layers. Any layer can then be dragged and dropped to the current project.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Directly Create Geopackage and Shapefiles ¶ Right clicking a directory in the browser panel now shows a \u0026quot;New\u0026quot; menu, containing items for creating a new Geopackage, Shapefile, or subdirectory under the selected directory.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Open Terminal at Path ¶ A new context menu entry has been added for browser panel directory items to open a new terminal window at that directory.\nOn Windows, this new terminal inherits the QGIS environment, so GDAL commands and Python scripts which use PyQGIS commands work without any further environment setup required.\nTerminal hackers rejoice!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nGeneral ¶ Feature: Improved \u0026quot;missing layer\u0026quot; handling on project load ¶ This feature was funded by A.R.P.A. Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Optional setting for disabling version checks ¶ A new setting, \u0026quot;allowVersionCheck\u0026quot; has been added to the QGIS configuration ini file. If set to true (the default), users may control whether the version check is enabled or disabled through the QGIS settings dialog. When this setting is set to false, no version checking will be performed AND users will NOT have an option to enable this check in the settings dialog.\nThis setting is intended for use in enterprise installs where QGIS version management is handled centrally.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add a toggle action to vector layer legend items ¶ This feature was funded by A.R.P.A. Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nData Providers ¶ Feature: Open service info for ArcGIS Feature Server layers ¶ ArcGIS Feature Server layers have a new right click menu option in the browser panel, allowing users to directly open the service information web page for the selected layer.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Binary blob support for OGR providers ¶ Instead of converting binary fields to truncated strings, these values are now retrievable as their original binary contents. This allows for plugins and scripts to utilise binary fields, such as extracting their contents.\nAdditionally, new binary fields can be created for compatible data sources.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: ArcGIS Feature Server picture marker and picture fill support ¶ When loading a Feature Server layer with picture marker or picture fill symbology, QGIS will automatically convert the ESRI picture marker and fill symbols and use them as the default style for the layer.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson, Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: ArcGIS Feature Server labeling support ¶ When a Feature Server layer has labeling defined by the server, these labeling settings will be automatically used by default when loading the layer into QGIS.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Boolean and binary field support for memory layers ¶ Memory (\u0026quot;Temporary scratch\u0026quot;) layers can now use binary and boolean (true/false) field types.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: JSON Support for GeoPackage ¶ Support for JSON allows to store structured data inside a single field in GeoPackage files.\nData which is saved as JSON can be represented and edited in\nValueRelation widgets with allow multiple selection activated KeyValue widgets List widgets or the QML widget which also supports visualizing JSON data This feature was funded by Kanton Zug, Amt für Geoinformation\nThis feature was developed by David Signer (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Postgres provider: save primary key selection ¶ When a view loaded from Data Source Managers's PostgreSQL tab you can select the key columns of the view (by default the first column is used, which can be wrong). This commit stores that selection in the settings, so that it doesn't have to be reselected on subsequent loads. This stored selection is also used when adding the loading from the browser.\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer\nFeature: ArcGIS Feature Server multi-field unique value support ¶ QGIS can now display a Feature Server layer with a multi-fiend unique value renderer setup.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Possibility to set ATLAS_PK in GetPrint request to print atlas sheet(s) ¶ The new GetPrint parameter accepts the primary key(s) for which atlas sheets should be printed, separated by comma,\nSuch a request would look like:\nhttps://yourserver.name/path/to/qgisproject?SERVICE=WMS\u0026amp;REQUEST=GetPrint \u0026amp;TEMPLATE=A4\u0026amp;FORMAT=pdf\u0026amp;ATLAS_PK=1,3,7 One can also provide an asterisk (*) for ATLAS_PK to request all features of an atlas. To protect the server against requesting too many features, it is possible to restrict it to a defined maximum of features that can be requested at one time (see attached screenshot).\nAs clients may not know which template has an atlas and which attribute(s) are the primary key of the coverage layer, this new feature also adds this information to the GetProjectSettings response of the WMS service.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Zug, Amt für Geoinformation\nThis feature was developed by Marco Hugentobler\nFeature: WMTS tile matrices configuration ¶ In QGIS Server 3.4, the WMTS API was added in which the tile matrices are calculated except for EPSG:3857 and EPSG:4326.\nThis change adds the capability to select the tile matrices to use with the project and to configure the top-left corner and the last level of the tile matrix. In the case of EPSG:3857 and EPSG:4326, the user can only choose the last level of the tile matrices.\nThis feature was funded by Ifremer\nThis feature was developed by 3liz\nFeature: Add JSON format for WMS GetFeatureInfo request ¶ Thanks to this new feature, the FORMAT parameter of GetFeatureInfo for the WMS service may take 'application/json' or 'application/geo+json' values. In this case, the document returned by the server looks something like this:\n{\u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;FeatureCollection\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;:[ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Feature\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;testlayer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;geometry\u0026quot;: {\u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Point\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;coordinates\u0026quot;: [913204.9128, 5606011.4565]}, \u0026quot;properties\u0026quot;:{ \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:3, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;three\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;utf8nameè\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;three\u0026quot; } }] } This feature was funded by Veolia\nThis feature was developed by Paul Blottiere (Oslandia)\nPlugins ¶ Feature: DB Manager: Adds buttons to load and save an external SQL file ¶ The new buttons allow the user to load and save the query in an external SQL file.\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti (Oslandia)\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: New class QgsExifTools ¶ Contains utilities for retrieving the geotag from images and for setting an image's geotag.\nWorking with geotags (before this class!) is super-annoying and fiddly and relies on either parsing command line tools or depending on non-standard Python libraries which are not available everywhere, and often very difficult for users on certain platforms to get installed and working correctly.\nWith this class we have stable methods for geotag getting/setting which are universally available and can be used safely by plugins and scripts.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Iterate over parts of a QgsGeometry ¶ This new PyQGIS API allows easy iteration over all the parts of a geometry, regardless of the geometry's type. E.g.\ngeometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'MultiPoint( 0 0, 1 1, 2 2)' ) for part in geometry.parts(): print(part.asWkt()) geometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'LineString( 0 0, 10 10 )' ) for part in geometry.parts(): print(part.asWkt()) There are two iterators available. QgsGeometry.parts() gives a non-const iterator, allowing the parts to be modified in place:\ngeometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'MultiPoint( 0 0, 1 1, 2 2)' ) for part in geometry.parts(): part.transform(ct) For a const iteration, calling .const_parts() gives a const iterator, which cannot edit the parts but avoids a potentially expensive QgsGeometry detach and clone\ngeometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt( 'MultiPoint( 0 0, 1 1, 2 2)' ) for part in geometry.const_parts(): print(part.x()) This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved QgsLineString PyQGIS API ¶ Some nice API additions have been made to the QgsLineString API:\nlen(QgsCurve) returns number of points in curve raise IndexErrors when calling pointN, xAt, yAt, zAt, mAt, setXAt, setYAt, setMAt, setZAt with invalid vertex indices Add [] getter for retrieving specific vertices, eg. ls[0] returns QgsPoint(...) Add [] setter for setting specific (existing) vertices, e.g. ls[1] = QgsPoint(1,2) Add del support for removing vertices, e.g. del ls[1] removes the second vertex This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: PyQGIS Geometry Collection API improvements ¶ The PyQGIS API for working with geometry collections has been improved:\nCalling removeGeometry with an invalid index will now raise an IndexError Calling collection[0] will return the first geometry in the collection, collection[1] the second, etc. And negative indices return from the end of the collection, so collection[-1] returns the last geometry in the collection. Geometries can be deleted by calling del collection[1] (deletes the second geometry from the collection). Also supports negative indices to count from the end of the collection. Additionally, you can now easily iterate over the geometries in the collection, allowing this type of code:\ngc = QgsGeometryCollection() gc.fromWkt('GeometryCollection( Point(1 2), Point(11 12), LineString(33 34, 44 45))') for part in gc: print(part.asWkt()) This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Easier Processing algorithm creation via @alg decorator ¶ Allows the following to define processing scripts without the need for implementing a custom class:\nfrom qgis.processing import alg\n| @alg(name=\u0026quot;test2\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;test 2\u0026quot;, group=\u0026quot;test\u0026quot;, groupid=\u0026quot;test\u0026quot;) | @alg.input(type=alg.STRING, name=\u0026quot;IN1\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;In string\u0026quot;) | @alg.input(type=str, name=\u0026quot;IN2\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;In string 1\u0026quot;, optional=True) | @alg.input(type=str, name=\u0026quot;IN3\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;In string 2\u0026quot;) | @alg.input(type=alg.SINK, name=\u0026quot;SINK\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;Sink it!\u0026quot;) | @alg.output(type=str, name=\u0026quot;OUT\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;WAT\u0026quot;) | @alg.output(type=alg.MAPLAYER, name=\u0026quot;OUT2\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;WAT\u0026quot;) | @alg.output(type=alg.VECTOR_LAYER, name=\u0026quot;VECTOR_LAYER\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;WAT\u0026quot;) | def testalg(instance, parms, context, feedback, inputs): | \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; | This is a test function that does stuff | \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; | feedback.pushInfo(\u0026quot;We got these inputs!!\u0026quot;) | feedback.pushInfo(inputs['IN1']) | feedback.pushInfo(inputs['IN2']) | feedback.pushInfo(inputs['IN3']) | return { | \u0026quot;OUT2\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;wat\u0026quot; | }\nThis feature was developed by Nathan Woodrow\nFeature: Blocking (non-async) network requests ¶ New PyQGIS API has been added for performing SAFE blocking requests. It is thread safe and has full support for QGIS proxy and authentication settings.\nreply = QgsNetworkAccessManager.blockingGet(...) reply = QgsNetworkAccessManager.blockingPut(...) This API should be used whenever a blocking network request is required. Unlike implementations which rely on QApplication::processEvents() or creation of a QEventLoop, this class is completely thread safe and can be used on either the main thread or background threads without issue.\nRedirects are automatically handled by the class.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Custom validity checks on layout exports ¶ See https://north-road.com/2019/01/14/on-custom-layout-checks-in-qgis-3-6-and-how-they-can-do-your-work-for-you/\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: API for calculating Geodesic lines ¶ New PyQGIS API for calculation of geodesic lines (shortest distance on an ellipsoid) has been added to QgsDistanceArea, which utilises the mature geographiclib library for geodesic calculations.\nQgsDistanceArea.geodesicLine : calculates the geodesic line between two points QgsDistanceArea.latitudeGeodesicCrossesAntimeridian calculates the latitude at which the geodesic line joining two points crosses the antimeridian QgsDistanceArea.splitGeometryAtAntimeridian : splits a (multi)linestring at the antimeridian, using geodesic lines to calculate the exact point at which the split occurs on the antimeridian This feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New class QgsQuadrilateral ¶ QgsRectangle does not propose the support of orientation or Z, since its role is for the extent. A new class called QgsQuadrilateral to manage 4 vertex polygons is created. For the moment, there are only rectangles, but it will be possible to add the other shapes later.\nThis refactoring simplifies maptools and allows you to use the QgsQuadrilateral class in other tools.\nIn addition, it will allow a better management of the Z for rectangles by 3 points. Today the first Z is used, now the points will have their Z and the 4th will be projected on the plane.\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti (Oslandia)\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Terrain shading ¶ This adds new options for user to choose how the terrain should be rendered: - shading disabled - color of terrain is determined only from map texture - shading enabled - color of terrain is determined using Phong's shading model, taking into account map texture, terrain normal vector, scene light(s) and terrain material's ambient+specular colors and shininess\nOptionally, terrains can be shaded using a preset map theme.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Configuration of lights in 3D map scenes ¶ This feature adds a section to define point lights in 3D scenes. Up to 8 lights are supported (limitation by implementation of materials). For each light one can set the position, intensity, color and attenuation.\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Rule-based 3D renderer ¶ This feature was funded by QGIS community\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Support for mesh layer (faces) in 3D ¶ With this feature, you can use mesh layer in 3D scene,\nThis feature was funded by Lutra Consulting\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.4 backport commit (GitHub) QGIS Server: WFS issue using the EXP_FILTER parameter #20927 PR #8924 Done GetFeatureInfo response empty for child relation table in QGIS Server 3 #20801 Cannot reproduce with 3.5 QGIS Server WFS DescribeFeatureType not following TYPENAME parameter #20198 PR #8948 Done QGIS Server 3.4 can't reset numeric field using WFS Update #20961 PR #8958 Done WFS provider shows numeric NULL fields with 0 instead of NULL #20961 PR #8958 Done OWS project title in project properties cannot be set to blank/empty unreported PR #8958 Done Form Value relation based on WFS layer #21077 PR #8970 Done Button positions in Database styles manager dialog #21068 PR #8971 Done raster calculator in processing does not work with Aspect raster #21011 Cannot reproduce with 3.5 Error opening network KML page: Range downloading not supported by this server! #21091 PR #8985 Done Can't add a virtual field or update a existing field of a WFS layer using the field calculator #21086 PR #8990 Done Opening shapefiles in ZIP gives Invalid Datasource #21097 Cannot reproduce with 3.5 spatialite, edit table in dbmanager is broken in master Fault: no such table: pg_description #21151 PR #9086 N/A Delimitedtext layer saves absolute path when project in relative path mode #21150 PR #9099 Done field calculator doesn't load values for gpkg containing blank spaces or n dash (hypen) in field names #21100 PR #9071 Done Can't open feature form when when the primary key of Spatialite layer is created in text type #21176 PR # No (deferred) Geopackage layer rename in DB Manager does not update f_table_name values in the layer_styles table or the Triggers #21227 PR #9164 Not possible because it relies on the new rename feature implemented in browser Layer Properties \u0026gt;

Previously, the measurement tools always used ellipsoidal/geodesic area and distance calculations, but there's occasions when this is not desirable and users require pure Cartesian calculations instead.\nThis feature was funded by Oslandia\nThis feature was developed by Loïc Bartoletti (Oslandia)\nUser Interface ¶ Feature: Save to Template Button ¶ While QGIS has offered support for Project Templates for many years, we enhanced this in 3.8 and made it much simpler for users to create new templates. Now, users can create a new template from their current project by selecting \u0026quot;Save To -\u0026gt; Templates\u0026quot; from the \u0026quot;Project\u0026quot; menu.\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Improved \u0026quot;Zoom to Native Resolution\u0026quot; behavior ¶ We've improved the \u0026quot;Zoom to Native\u0026quot; action, so it now works correctly with tiled (e.g. WMTS/XYZ/ArcGIS MapServer) layers, by zooming to the closest native tile resolution. Additionally, we tweaked tile rendering so that pixel-perfect rendering occurs when the map is viewed at a native tile resolution. The result: super-crisp map renders when using tiled layer sources!\nFeature: Drag and Drop Layers to Map Layer widgets ¶ To improve the usability of large QGIS projects, we now support direct drag and drop of layers from the project table of contents to any widget which asks for a map layer selection (e.g. Processing algorithms). For complex projects, locating a layer in the table of contents and dragging it is much easier then picking it from the flat map layer widget combo box!\nAdditionally, for Processing algorithms, layers can be dragged direct from the Browser panel to input layer choices.\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nSymbology ¶ Feature: Multi-character strings for font markers ¶ While QGIS has long offered support for rendering points using font-based character markers, we've enhanced this functionality in 3.8 and now offer the ability to render multi-character strings! And since we're always aiming to make the QGIS application interface as user-friendly and pleasant to use as possible, we also took the opportunity to tweak the UI for font markers and squash a number of frustrating GUI issues which previous versions suffered from.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Point Displacement label distance factor ¶ Another addition to the new symbology features added in 3.8 is a brand new label distance factor control for Point Displacement markers. This option allows displaced marker labels to be placed at a distance based on the actual marker diagonal size instead of a fixed distance.\nThis feature was developed by henrik\nFeature: Hash Line symbol type ¶ QGIS loves cartography, and we know you love making pretty maps! So we've added a brand-new line symbology option for \u0026quot;Hashed Lines\u0026quot;. This line symbol type is designed to replicate the ArcGIS Hash Line symbol layer type, and allows for a repeating line segment to be drawn over the length of a feature (with a line-sub symbol used to render each individual segment).\nAll options available for the existing Marker Line symbol layer are also available for hash lines, - e.g. first/last vertex, mid points, regular intervals, data-defined intervals, etc. The hash line length and angle can also have data defined overrides, which are evaluated per-line segment, allowing for the hash line to change size and angle over the length of a single rendered feature.\nThis feature was funded by anonymous\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Average line angles for marker and hashed line symbology ¶ In previous QGIS versions, when a marker line was rendered using interval or center point place placement, the symbol angles were determined by taking the exact line orientation at the position of the symbol. This often leads to undesirable rendering effects, where little \u0026quot;jaggies\u0026quot; or corners in lines which occur right at the position of the symbol cause the marker to be oriented at a very different angle to what the eye expects to see.\nWe want your maps to be as beautiful as possible, so in QGIS 3.8 the marker angle is instead calculated by averaging the line over a specified distance either side of the symbol. E.g. averaging the line angle over 4mm means we take the points along the line 2mm from either side of the symbol placement, and use these instead to calculate the line angle for that symbol. This has the effect of smoothing (or removing!) any tiny local deviations from the overall line direction, resulting in much nicer visual orientation of marker or hash lines.\nLike all symbol settings, the average angle smoothing distance can be set using mm/pixels/map units/etc, and supports data-defined values. Closed rings also correctly consider wrapping around these average angles from the start/end vertex.\nThis option is available for both the marker line symbol and the new hash line symbol types.\nThis feature was funded by anonymous\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Offset settings for point pattern fill symbol layers ¶ To round out the new symbology options we've added in 3.8, the Point Pattern Fill symbol type has a new setting allowing for offsetting the markers in the pattern by a preset (or data-defined!) amount. This opens the door for many styling possibilities which were not possible in earlier versions, and further increases our compatibility with converted ArcGIS symbol and layer styles.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Live Effects Blur Radius is now hi-dpi friendly ¶ QGIS 3.8 brings a highly-desired fix to layer effects' blurring radius (aka strength). In earlier QGIS versions, these blur settings did not take into account the DPI of the map render \u0026mdash; resulting in inaccurate effects rendering when exporting canvases/layouts at high resolutions. In 3.8, this was fixed and high-resolution map exports now match the results shown on the map canvas and are completely resolution-independent.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nLabelling ¶ Feature: Geometry generators for labeling ¶ This is a huge one! During the developer's meeting in A Coruña, Matthias Kuhn took the opportunity to implement a frequently-asked-for feature in our labeling engine: Geometry Generator support.\nJust like Geometry Generators for symbols, we now allow label paths and positions to be calculated using dynamically-evaluated geometry expressions. You can take advantage of the rich support for geometry processing which QGIS' expression engine exposes, and use this to do ALL sorts of pre-processing to your feature geometries before they are labelled. Want to place labels around the start or end point of linestring geometries? What about dynamically smoothing and simplifying the path used for labeling river features, based on the current map scale? How about buffering polygon objects inward by a percentage of their area, and then labeling around the perimeter of this shrunken area? Now, it's ALL possible, thanks to the power of labeling geometry generators!\nThis feature was funded by QGIS user group switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Matthias Kuhn (OPENGIS.ch)\nFeature: Label Map Tools now use click-click behavior ¶ Like the other QGIS digitizing and map tools, the \u0026quot;Move Label\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Rotate Label\u0026quot; tools now use the standard left-click-to-start edit, left-click-to-end behavior. Consistency is good!\n3D Features ¶ Feature: Wide lines and polygon edge highlighting ¶ Like all recent QGIS releases, in version 3.8 we've significantly boosted QGIS' 3D rendering capabilities. New 3D rendering features include:\nConfigurable line width (in screen units) for \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot; 3D lines (in previous versions they were always 1px wide) Optional highlighting of edges of 3D polygons This feature was funded by Andreas Neumann\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Export 3d animations ¶ Another exciting change we've introduced in QGIS 3.8 is the ability to export your 3D animations! These are exported as a series of png/jpg/... images, which can be easily merged into .avi or other standard video files (using external tools).\nThis feature was funded by Northumberland National Park Authority\nThis feature was developed by Peter Petrik (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Terrain from online sources ¶ With this new version 3.8 feature, you can now directly fetch terrains for your 3D scenes from online sources (e.g. tiles hosted on AWS). No more sourcing and preparing rasters with DEM, just enable this option and see beautiful 3D scenes out-of-the-box!\nThis feature was funded by Crowdfunding: More QGIS 3D\nThis feature was developed by Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting)\nFeature: Configuration of field of view angle of camera ¶ In QGIS 3.8, the field of view of the camera through which 3D scenes are rendered has gained a new configurable field of view settings.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nPrint Layouts ¶ Feature: Distribute spacing between items evenly ¶ To make it easy to create your perfect QGIS Print Layout, we added new tools for automatically re-positioning items so that horizontal or vertical space between them is equal. This addition nicely rounds out the existing options for aligning items, bringing more of the power of a dedicated DTP application directly inside the QGIS Print Layout Designer!\nThis feature was developed by Matteo Nastasi\nFeature: North Arrow Creation ¶ We've listened to user feedback which indicated that the previous approach for creating north arrows within print layouts was too difficult, and consequently have added a new button in the Print Layout Designer for direct north arrow creation. This button is a shortcut to adding a picture item, setting it to a north arrow picture, and linking it with a map. The end result is identical, but it's much easier for new users to understand if we expose it as an explicit \u0026quot;North Arrow\u0026quot; item!\nEven experienced users will likely appreciate the improved workflow, including automatically linking the picture rotation to a sensible default map choice (if a map is selected, it's used. If not, the topmost map item under the newly drawn north arrow is used. If there's none, the layout's 'reference map' (or biggest map) is used as a fallback).\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nExpressions ¶ Feature: Order by support for expression aggregate and concatenation functions ¶ Since certain aggregate and concatenation expressions require results in a certain order, we now allow control over the order features are added to the aggregate during expression evaluation.\nE.g. concatenate(\u0026quot;Station\u0026quot;,concatenator:=',', order_by:=\u0026quot;Station\u0026quot;) will give a comma-separated list of station names in alphabetical order, rather than layer feature order.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Simplified variant of \u0026quot;attribute\u0026quot; function ¶ This improvement brings a second variant for the existing \u0026quot;attribute\u0026quot; function. The \u0026quot;attribute\u0026quot; function in previous QGIS releases required both a target feature and attribute name to be specified. The new version is much simpler, automatically using the current feature and only requiring an attribute name.\nE.g.\nPrevious behavior:\nattribute($currentfeature, 'name' ) -\u0026gt; returns value stored in 'name' attribute for the current feature\nImproved behavior:\nattribute( 'name' ) -\u0026gt; returns the value stored in 'name' attribute for the current feature\nIt's just a faster shorthand version!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Retrieve vertices from the end of geometeries ¶ We added negative index support to the point_n(), angle_at_vertex(), and distance_to_vertex() functions, allowing for retrieval of vertices counting backward from the end of a geometry.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: New expression functions ¶ As always, a new QGIS release brings a bunch of new functions for use within QGIS' expression engine. These new functions add increased flexibility and power to the expression engine, and everywhere it's used throughout QGIS. This round, we've added a set of new functions which make it super-easy to operate on file names and paths.\nNew expression functions developed by Nyall Dawson of North Road:\nbase_file_name: Returns the base name of the file without the directory or file suffix. file_exists: Returns true if a file exists file_name: Returns the file name from a full path file_path: Returns the directory/path from a full file path file_size: Returns a file size file_suffix: Returns a files suffix/extension is_directory: Returns true if a file path is a directory is_file: Returns true if a file path is a file New expressions functions developed by Mathieu Pellerin of iMHere Asia:\narray_all: Returns true if an array contains the all values of a given array. concatenate_unique: Returns all unique strings from a field or expression joined by a delimiter. Feature: New aggregation method: concatenate_unique ¶ We added a new function concatenate_unique() to the expression engine (and Processing's \u0026quot;aggregate\u0026quot; algorithm) to support concatenating only unique values from a list or set of features.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nDigitising ¶ Feature: Floating widget for advanced input next to cursor ¶ To make the existing Advanced Digitizing tools easier to use, we added an option to show the current distance/angle/x/y values as a floating display next to the mouse cursor.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Schaffhausen\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang and OPENGIS.ch\nFeature: Chained add vertex at the endpoint ¶ In QGIS 3.0, we added the ability to extend an existing line feature by clicking a \u0026quot;+\u0026quot; indicator at the start or end of line features when using the node tool. Version 3.8 extends this functionality by allowing addition of more than one vertex using the \u0026quot;+\u0026quot; button.\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Schaffhausen\nThis feature was developed by Olivier Dalang and OPENGIS.ch\nFeature: Improvements in the vertex editor ¶ For this release we improved the vertex editor so it will now properly link the selected vertices on the canvas with the vertices for manual coordinate editing in the table.\nThis feature was funded by QGIS User Group Switzerland\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud, OPENGIS.ch\nForms and Widgets ¶ Feature: Allow browsing feature list ¶ | arrows allow browsing the feature list in the attribute table in form view | the current edited feature can be highlighted and the map canvas automatically panned or zoomed\nFeature: HTML Form Widget ¶ Thanks to the generous sponsorship by A.R.P.A Piemonte (one of the italian regional environmental agencies) we developed a new form widget with HTML body and access to feature values and expressions.\nThis feature was funded by A.R.P.A. Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Form widgets custom background color ¶ Thanks to the generous sponsorship by A.R.P.A Piemonte (one of the italian regional environmental agencies) we finally freed you from the boredom of gray backgrounds.\nThis feature was funded by A.R.P.A. Piemonte\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Browse through features in the attribute table form view ¶ We've added the possibility to browse through the attributes of features in a layer. This makes workflows for asset management a lot easier! You can:\nDefine a filter Browse through all matching features Review and adjust You can also pan and zoom to the geometry of the feature or highlight the current feature as you browse.\n(This replaces the previous ItemBrowser plugin with equivalent inbuilt functionality.)\nThis feature was funded by regioDATA\nThis feature was developed by Denis Rouzaud, OPENGIS.ch\nProcessing ¶ Feature: Add \u0026quot;Save layer styles into GeoPackage\u0026quot; option for Package Layers algorithm ¶ QGIS loves GeoPackage, so it's likely no surprise that every new QGIS version brings improvements to GeoPackage handling! In 3.8, we enhanced the \u0026quot;Package Layers\u0026quot; Processing algorithm so that it now allows embedding the current layer styles directly into the packaged layers!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Overlap Analysis ¶ This new Processing algorithm calculates the area and percentage cover by which features from an input layer are overlapped by features from a selection of overlay layers. New attributes are added to the output layer reporting the total area of overlap and percentage of the input feature overlapped by each of the selected overlay layers.\nThis is quite a common GIS task request, yet is full of traps for inexperienced users, and the amount of manual data work usually done by users to calculate these figures can often lead to mistakes and inaccurate results. We want to make spatial analysis as easy and foolproof as possible, so we've added Overlap Analysis as an inbuilt tool which allows this task to be done in a single step without risk of human error.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Allow rounding values in Extract Layer Extent ¶ We've added a parameter to the Processing algorithm 'Extract Layer Extent' to round the extent bounding box coordinates to a certain interval. While rounding, the bounding box will only ever be enlarged, to ensure it will always cover the input data set. (I.e. the x and y minimum coordinates are rounded down, and x and y maximum coordinates are rounded up).\nThis feature was developed by Raymond Nijssen\nFeature: New options for autofilling batch Processing ¶ In QGIS 3.8 we moved the existing \u0026quot;double click column header\u0026quot; to fill values down functionality to a new \u0026quot;Auto fill\u0026quot; button in the Processing Batch dialog, making this feature much more user-discoverable (we suspect many users had no idea this handy shortcut even existed!). In addition, we've added TONS of new functionality to easily auto-populate the batch table. These include:\nFile or layer parameters can now be batch populated by searching for files in a directory with a matching filename pattern (including recursive searches!). Ever needed to auto convert 100s of Shapefiles from a set of folders? Now it's easy to do! An option to add calculated values from a QGIS expression, allowing complex range-based values to be added to the dialog (e.g. values from 100-1000, increasing by 50) A \u0026quot;Calculate by Expression\u0026quot; option allows for updating existing batch table cells using the results of a QGIS expression. These expressions can freely utilise other parameter values from the input batch rows, making it easy to craft the exact output file name you desire based on the other columns values in a batch row. This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Generate raster XYZ tiles ¶ We've added a brand-new algorithm to generate raster \u0026quot;XYZ\u0026quot; tiles using the current QGIS project. Tile images can be saved as individual images in directory structure, or as a single file in the \u0026quot;MBTiles\u0026quot; format.\nThis feature was funded by Hansestadt Herford, SWK mbH, Datenbankgesellschaft mbH\nThis feature was developed by Lutra Consulting\nFeature: Resurrection of the OTB provider ¶ QGIS 3.8 brings back the OTB Processing provider, which was removed in the QGIS 3.0 update. The provider was updated to use all the new goodies which are available in Processing in QGIS 3, and is once again available out-of-the-box for all your imagery analysis requirements!\n(Note that OTB is a third party dependency which must be manually installed by users. Instructions on installing OTB are available `here \u0026lt;https://gitlab.orfeo-toolbox.org/orfeotoolbox/qgis-otb-plugin#open-processing-settings\u0026gt;`__)\nThis feature was developed by Rashad Kanavath\nFeature: Expression variables for a model ¶ We've added a new \u0026quot;Model Variables\u0026quot; dock panel to the model editor, allowing you to create and set custom expression variables for use in your Processing models. These variables are available anywhere expressions are evaluated within the model, so you can use them as input parameter values for child algorithms, within data-defined dynamic parameters, etc.\nThe prime use case here is for models which use a constant value throughout multiple steps within the model (e.g. @target_resolution: a target raster resolution, @max_simplification: a simplification value for input features coming from different sources, etc). Previously, you'd need to hunt down and replace these values in multiple places when you wanted to tweak them. By replacing them with variables in your model you only have a single place you need to edit these values when you want to adjust them!\nModel variables are stored within an individual Processing model itself, and are not exposed outside of the model designer dialog.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved modeler UI ¶ We've added numerous usability improvements to the Processing Graphical Modeler, including\nThe addition of helpful tooltips when hovering over model components Algorithms and inputs connected to model components are highlighted as you hover the mouse over different parts of the model, making it much easier to visualise the model flow and connections inside complex models Input parameter types are now shown in the title of the parameter definition dialog The data type for numeric parameters may now be specified, allowing for integer-only inputs for models This feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Flagging algorithms with known issues ¶ By default, we now hide 3rd party algorithms with known issues from the Processing toolbox, helping you avoid frustration (or misleading results) when running these algorithms. A new setting in the Processing options screen allows these algorithms to be shown, but they will be highlighted in the toolbox with a warning icon. Use at your own risk!\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Raster Boolean logical OR/AND algorithms ¶ In version 3.8 we've added new algorithms which calculate the boolean OR or AND for a set of input rasters. For AND, if all of the input rasters have a non-zero value for a pixel, that pixel will be set to 1 in the output raster, otherwise it will be set to 0. For OR, if ANY of the input rasters have a non-zero value for a pixel, that pixel will be set to 1 in the output raster, else 0.\nA reference layer parameter allows you to specify an existing raster layer to use as a reference when creating the output raster. The output raster will have the same extent, CRS, and pixel dimensions as this layer.\nBy default, a nodata pixel in ANY of the input layers will result in a nodata pixel in the output raster. If you check the 'Treat nodata values as false' option, then nodata inputs will be treated the same as a 0 input value.\nThese new algorithms make for much simpler raster boolean logic calculation, without the complexity of using the raster calculator. They are also dynamically scalable to any number of input rasters (unlike the raster calculator), so are much more flexible when used within your Processing models.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New input parameter types for Print Layouts and Print Layout Items ¶ By adding new parameter types for Print Layouts and Print Layout items, we've opened up QGIS 3.8 to a whole new world of Processing algorithms which operate on print layouts. These new parameter types allow for creation of Processing algorithms and graphical models which prompt users to select a print layout and/or an item on the layout when run.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New parameter type for Map Scales ¶ We've added a new parameter type specifically for map scales, QgsProcessingParameterScale. Scale values are evaluated using self.parameterAsDouble, which return the map scale denominator (matching the standard in other parts of the QGIS API).\nScale parameters are displayed to users using the standard QgsScaleWidget, which includes the combo box of predefined scales and a shortcut button to match the current map scale. The addition of this new parameter type allows you to create Processing algorithms and models which require a scale choice at run time.\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Improved \u0026quot;point\u0026quot; parameter handling ¶ We improved the workflow for algorithms with a \u0026quot;point\u0026quot; input parameter. When picking the point coordinate from a map you can now take advantage of QGIS snapping tools, allowing you to exactly match the point parameter to a feature's boundary.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: New \u0026quot;Print Layout Map Extent to Layer\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ Taking advantage of the new facilities for accessing Print Layouts in Processing, we added a new algorithm which creates a polygon layer containing the extent of a print layout map item. The output layer also includes handy attributes specifying the map size (in layout units), scale and rotation.\nIf you've ever wanted to create an advanced overview indicator, and the inbuilt layout tools haven't sufficed \u0026mdash; this new algorithm is for you!\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Add X/Y fields to layer ¶ This new algorithm is a handy shortcut for adding X and Y (or latitude/longitude) fields to a point layer. You can even calculate the X/Y values using a different coordinate reference system from the layer (e.g. creating latitude/longitude fields for a layer in a projected CRS).\nThis feature was funded by SMEC/SJ\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: \u0026quot;Join attributes by nearest\u0026quot; algorithm ¶ You can now perform K-nearest neighbour joins from the Processing toolbox!\nQGIS 3.8 brings a new algorithm which takes an input vector layer and creates a new vector layer with additional attributes in its attribute table. The additional attributes and their values are taken from a second vector layer, where features are joined by finding the closest features from each layer.\nBy default only the single nearest feature is joined, but optionally the join can use the n-nearest neighboring features instead. If a maximum distance is specified, then only features which are closer than this distance will be matched.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nFeature: Grass r.geomorphon algorithm ¶ The upstream GRASS team has been hard at work creating a new GRASS module for terrain analysis \u0026mdash; \u0026quot;r.geomorphon\u0026quot;. In 3.8 we expose their efforts via a new Processing tool, which calculates geomorphons (terrain forms) and associated geometry using a machine learning approach.\nFeature: GDAL pansharpening algorithm ¶ Another third party tool which we've added to the Processing toolbox in QGIS 3.8 is the GDAL pansharpening tool. Now it's easy to take advantage of this fast, powerful tool in your Processing analysis scripts and models.\nThis feature was developed by Alexander Bruy\nFeature: New fields prefix parameter for overlay algorithms ¶ We've added overlay layer fields prefix parameter for the following algorithms:\nintersection algorithm line intersection algorithm symmetrical difference algorithm union algorithm This can come in very handy to avoid arbitrary colliding field renaming when merging layers.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nBrowser ¶ Feature: Direct access to sheets from XLSX/ODS files ¶ QGIS 3.8 brings even more power to the browser panel, and now displays all sheets from spreadsheet files (e.g. Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice calc files) in the browser file tree.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nGeneral ¶ Feature: QGIS projects inside geopackage files ¶ Did we already say that QGIS loves GeoPackage? Need any more proof of this? Well, in QGIS 3.8, we've added to ability to store QGIS projects directly inside GeoPackage files! Now you can create a totally self-contained GeoPackage which embeds a QGIS Project AND all the data used by the project. (Let's see Shapefiles match that one!)\nThis feature was funded by QCooperative\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nFeature: Much Improved Coordinate Transform Handling ¶ Thanks to underlying work from the tireless PROJ and GDAL teams, QGIS now sports many huge improvements in geodetic and transformation capabilities! Highlights include:\nThe PROJ CRS database is now used to populate QGIS' CRS selection lists, removing the custom database we used in previous releases. This means that ALL responsibility for CRS definitions and updating these sit were they belong, upstream in the PROJ library -- and consequently you can expect to see QGIS CRS definitions being a closer match to the official definitions, and newer CRS definitions will be added much faster than in previous releases.. This change also means we'll be an exact match for projection handling as all other open-source geospatial tools which have completed the port to the latest PROJ version, such as GDAL 3.0. We now rely entirely on PROJ's wonderful logic for generating the best coordinate operation to transform between CRS pairs. This means (amongst other stuff), we correctly support complex things like operations which require a \u0026quot;pivot datum\u0026quot;, e.g. transformation to and from the GDA2020 coordinate systems. Instead of the older approach QGIS used for datum transformations (carrying around our own table of when grid shift files can be used), we now use PROJ to determine these. This considerably changes the user interface shown when a user has opted into selecting manually a transform to use when multiple transforms exist, and we now show a simplified list of available (and non-available) pathways. We also use PROJ's database to populate lists of available ellipsoids for use in distance and area calculations. This has cleaned up the ellipsoid choices considerably, and added many additional ellipsoid definitions as a result. The UX for notifying users about issues in coordinate transforms is greatly improved, e.g. users are now alerted when a more accurate transform is possible, but not usable on their system (due to missing .GSB grid shift files). Wherever possible, we present users with direct download links to obtain these required/desired grid shift files. The intention here is to ensure users are informed when transforms can be improved, instead of silently falling back to less accurate options. Users also now have the option of placing grid shift files in a \u0026quot;proj\u0026quot; folder under their QGIS user profile. This change means users can install grid shift files and make them available in QGIS without requiring administrative rights. We've also completed a project which began back in the lead-up to 3.0, which ensures that project-specific transformation pathway settings are correctly respected EVERYWHERE a coordinate transform is performed. This also means we're ready for the next stage in handling 4d temporal based coordinate transforms (when these start to land in 2020 and beyond). A lot of this is only possible thanks to improvements in the underlying PROJ and GDAL libraries, which landed as a result of the GDAL \u0026quot;barn raising\u0026quot; effort. On the QGIS side, it was ONLY possible thanks to funding from the Australian ICSM.\nThis feature was funded by ICSM\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nData Providers ¶ Feature: postgres provider: add support for generated identity columns ¶ This feature was developed by jef-n\nFeature: String List support for compatible layers ¶ QGIS 3.8 now fully supports disk-based layers with String List fields, allowing you to take advantage of QGIS' flexible handling of list field types with these formats.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Much Improved ArcGIS MapServer Handling ¶ We rebuilt the ArcGIS MapServer provider, adding significant improvements over previous versions:\nTiled layers are now loaded progressively, with immediate feedback We significantly optimised the provider, resulting in much faster map redraws MapServer layers now correctly respect authentication settings and HTTP referrer settings. \u0026quot;Nested\u0026quot; services are correctly shown in the QGIS browser panel ImageServer services can be added using the provider End result: MapServer layers are now silky smooth in QGIS!\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road) \u0026amp; Mathieu Pellerin (iMHere Asia)\nFeature: SQL Server: handle v2 geometries, including curved and Z/M geometries ¶ SQL Server users rejoice: QGIS now fully supports curved geometry types (and other \u0026quot;version 2\u0026quot; geometry fields)!\nIn past QGIS versions, the SQL Server provider would only handle version 1 type geometries, and could only show straight feature types. In 3.8, we've added full support for version 2 geometries. This change also allows full support for Z or M enabled geometry types! Additionally, we fixed several known issues with geography field types.\nThis feature was developed by Tamas Szekeres\nFeature: WMS: Define one filter for several layers ¶ Sometimes, you need to define the same filter for every selected layer when making a WMS request (e.g. when accessing user-specific data). In previous QGIS versions we had to define the filter using the format:\n\u0026amp;FILTER=layer1:\u0026quot;column1\u0026quot; = 'value1';layer2:\u0026quot;column1\u0026quot; = 'value1';layer3:\u0026quot;column1\u0026quot; = 'value1'\nWith QGIS 3.8, we've simplified this, and now allow the filter format:\n\u0026amp;FILTER=layer1,layer2,layer3:\u0026quot;column1\u0026quot; = 'value1'\nThis feature was funded by VEOLIA\nThis feature was developed by Julien Cabieces (Oslandia)\nFeature: Support for curves in DXF export ¶ You can now export curved geometry layers to DXF format without segmentizing the features \u0026mdash; no more loss of curves!\nThis feature was funded by Kanton Schaffhausen\nThis feature was developed by Jürgen Fischer in collaboration with Matthias Kuhn\nQGIS Server ¶ Feature: Allow configuring size for GetLegendGraphics ¶ | For this release we improved how the legend for QGIS servers handles the size of symbols which are scaled by map units. | Whenever possible, the server will determine the legend size based on the map canvas and resolution. Even more, for cases where this information is not available in the GetLegend request, it is now possible to configure a default scale in the project, symbols in the legend will then be drawn in the size they will have when rendered at this scale.\nThis feature was developed by David Signer, OPENGIS.ch\nPlugins ¶ Feature: Support for plugin dependencies ¶ In QGIS 3.8, we've introduced a long-sought-after feature for QGIS plugin developers: the ability to specify dependencies for your plugins.\nTo add a plugin dependancy, you can use the new metadata \u0026quot;plugin_dependencies\u0026quot;. The format is a comma-separated list of PIP-like plugin names (with optional version). E.g:\nplugin_dependencies=GeoCoding,IPyConsole==1.9\nThe example above will require:\nAny version of GeoCoding Version 1.9 of IPyConsole When a plugin is installed, the metadata is parsed and a user will be prompted with a dialog listing the dependencies. The user can then decide what to do with the dependencies:\nInstall Upgrade/downgrade Do nothing This feature was funded by GISCE TI\nThis feature was developed by Alessandro Pasotti\nProgrammability ¶ Feature: REGEXP SQL syntax support for spatialite provider and python connections ¶ We've enabled REGEX to be used with the spatialite provider. (This comes in handy when setting filters!). We've also added support for this syntax via any python connections made through Qgis.utils's \u0026quot;spatialite_connection\u0026quot; API - allowing you to use REGEXP in your SQL queries from within DB Manager.\nThis feature was developed by Mathieu Pellerin\nFeature: Nearest Neighbour search in QgsSpatialIndex ¶ We added API to allow accurate nearest neighbor search based on QgsGeometry to QgsGeometry searches via QgsSpatialIndex. In previous QGIS versions only point to geometry nearest neighbour searches were possible. But with this change, you can safely and accurately use QgsSpatialIndex to determine the nearest neighbours between any types of geometries.\nThis feature was funded by North Road\nThis feature was developed by Nyall Dawson (North Road)\nNotable Fixes ¶ Feature: Bug fixes by Alessandro Pasotti ¶ Bug Title URL issues.qgis.org (if reported) URL Commit (Github) 3.4 backport commit (GitHub) Raster Calculator wrong results #21405 fixed in master QGIS server ignores custom rendering order when loading parent group #21917 PR #9878 Done WMS Client: GetFeatureInfo in JSON format doesn't display numeric attribute values #21735 PR #9879 Done Crash when adding New Field to ShapeLayer #22100 Priority in labelling not greyed out when data defined settings are enabled #22077 Invalid $length return bad value #22105 works for me (and for everybody) Relation reference widget wrong feature when \u0026quot;on map identification\u0026quot; #22071 Map composer: \u0026quot;href\u0026quot; HTML attribute issue in PDF output #22075 won't fix Issue exporting raster layer to Geopackage #20848 PR #10036 Done Create vector New shapefile POLYGON #22107 invalid \u0026quot;Export to PostgreSQL\u0026quot; python error if rather schema has an uppercase letter in its name #22035 PR #10063 Relation reference widget wrong feature when \u0026quot;on map identification\u0026quot; #22071 PR #10047 Done DB Manger imports the wrong data #22033 PR #10077 Done qgis crash when filtering a layer with an attachment field #21775 Fixed by Nyall Raster calculator, abs() not working #29824 PR #29965 Done Valid file URL link fails in Identify window #29879 PR #29967 Done QgsProject.instance().clear() crashes QGIS when LayoutDesigner Window is open #29821 PR #29968 Done QGIS Server WFS DescribeFeatureType advertises double precision virtual fields as integer #29767 PR #29970 Done QGIS crahses when exporting a template #29798 PR #29981 Done Export atlas as image fail when expression filename contain dot #29980 PR #29983 Done Buttons to adjust marker size in the digitizing tab of the general settings dialog not work #29987 PR #29991 Map Composer crashes QGIS when copying mixture of elements in page layout #29747 PR #30017 TODO QGIS crashes with PostgreSQL views #29673 cannot reproduce and cannot ask for feedback Browser - \u0026quot;Project home\u0026quot; folder shortcut does not appear when a new project is saved #29919 PR #30025 TODO Crash when calling QgsRasterHistogram.histogramVector #29700 PR #30033 Done Do not offer to \u0026quot;Import settings from Qgis2?\u0026quot; if no such settings exist #30082 PR #30092 Done In gpkg, query builder prevents autogenerate of pasted feature with same fid as hidden feature #30062 PR #30096 TODO Drag and drop geopackage from filesystem into map misses vector layers, loses names for raster layers #30050 PR #30098 Done Qgis crashes when try to identify a layer with duplicated fields #29937 PR #30100 TODO label properties will not saved to project files (buffer and background) #29882 works for me on release-3_4 and master Saving edits to a layer with JSON field throws an error #30131 PR #30137 Risky?

To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they\u0026rsquo;re participating within this community and project. These rules apply equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t an exhaustive list of things that you can\u0026rsquo;t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it\u0026rsquo;s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.\nThis code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the QGIS project. This includes IRC, the mailing lists, the issue tracker, DSF events, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication.\nIf you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing psc@qgis.org.\nBe welcoming, friendly, and patient ¶ Be considerate ¶ Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we\u0026rsquo;re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else\u0026rsquo;s primary language.\nBe respectful ¶ Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the QGIS community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the QGIS community.\nBe careful in the words that you choose ¶ We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren\u0026rsquo;t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:\nViolent threats or language directed against another person.\nSexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\nPosting sexually explicit or violent material.\nPosting (or threatening to post) other people\u0026rsquo;s personally identifying information (\u0026ldquo;doxing\u0026rdquo;).\nPersonal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.\nUnwelcome sexual attention.\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\nRepeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.\nWhen we disagree, try to understand why ¶ Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and QGIS is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we\u0026rsquo;re different. The strength of QGIS comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that they\u0026rsquo;re wrong. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn\u0026rsquo;t get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.\nOriginal text courtesy of the Speak Up! project, and Django Code of conduct\nIf you have questions, feel free to contact us: psc@qgis.org\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/conduct/","tags":null,"title":"Code of Conduct"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Commercial support ¶ Do you plan to use QGIS in your company or organization, but worry about whether there is commercial support available?

It is a charter member of the UNESCO Fundy Biosphere Reserve and affiliated with the NB Trails Council Inc. and the Trans Canada Trail. The Footpath takes hikers through the coastal Acadian Forest, home to the world\u0026rsquo;s highest tides, old growth forests, and several rare and unique types of flora and fauna.\nThe trail was created, is maintained, and promoted by a group of volunteers known as the Fundy Hiking Trail Association Inc. (FHTA)(1975). As a non-profit organization the FHTA raises funds for its activities through the sale of guidebooks that include a trail map. In 2011 I approached the FHTA to volunteer to update the official trail map. As a volunteer creating a map for a non-profit organization QGIS fit the bill as both a tool for editing data and for final map layout. Through the efforts of myself and members of the FHTA the new official map of the Fundy Footpath included with the guidebook was created from start to finish with QGIS.\nQGIS GPS Tools Plugin for data collection The Project ¶ The process of creating the new Fundy Footpath map with QGIS can be broken down into three different parts:\nData collection. Data editing and preparation. Map production. Data was collected both with handheld GPS units and from various free data sources. Trail data (e.g. trail centerline, campsite locations, and tidal crossings) was collected with a Garmin GPSMap 60CSX. This data was then transferred from the GPS and to shapefile format in QGIS using the GPS plugin. Free data in vector formats was then obtained from the Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) CanVec website and from Service New Brunswick (SNB) online.\nCreation of the footpath map in QGIS To prepare the data for use in the final map product the following tools within QGIS were used to accomplish specific tasks:\nThe data collected with GPS was cleaned using the editing toolbar. The vector data obtained from NRCan and SNB was merged together, queried, and clipped for the final map area using the vector tools. A comma-separated file obtained from SNB was imported to QGIS as a point layer using the Add Delimited Text Layer plugin, the Interpolation plugin was used to create an elevation raster that was then used to create a hillshade raster and elevation contour layer with the GDAL raster tools plugin. Footpath map in the Print Composer Once the data required to create the map was assembled and in a usable format the creation of the final map was started. To create the hiking map data was symbolized and labeled with the symbolization properties dialog and labeled with QGIS\u0026rsquo;s very functional label engine. Once labels and symbolization were in place the map composer tool was run to create the layout. It was very easy to add useful map elements such as a custom north arrow and elevation profile in the print composer. Two layouts were created since it was to be a double-sided map. Once both layouts were created they were exported as PDF files and sent to the printers.\nConclusion ¶ The hiking map was printed on heavy-duty waterproof paper, folded and inserted in the back of the new edition of the Fundy Footpath Hiker\u0026rsquo;s Guide Book. QGIS was the best and most functional choice for the creation of this map. Being free software the price was right for a volunteer creating a map for a non-profit organization. But the real advantage of QGIS was that it had all of the functionality and tools required to create a highly useful and detailed hiking map from start to finish. I would highly recommend QGIS to both experienced and beginning GIS users alike.\nThe final Fundy Footpath map with accompanying guidebook Links ¶ http://fundy-biosphere.ca/en/about-us/the-reserve http://www.sentiernbtrail.com http://www.snb.ca/gdam-igec/e/2900e_1.asp Author ¶ Jarrett Totton This article was contributed by Jarrett Totton in January 2013.

DDG Afghanistan delivers humanitarian mine action to save life, strengthen the sense of safety through risk education and help remove obstacles to the productive use of resources, helping to realise Afghanistan\u0026rsquo;s development potential. Since the start of operations in Afghanistan, DDG has removed over 24,000 landmines and over 940,000 pieces of UXO. Currently, DDG is working in the northern provinces of Balkh and Samangan, and the central provinces of Kabul, Parwan and Panjshir.\nIn Afghanistan, mineclearance activities are coordinated through the Mine Action Coordination Centre for Afghanistan (MACCA), who collect and disseminate geospatial information on known hazards (minefields, battlefields, \u0026lsquo;spot\u0026rsquo; UXO tasks), and update this information as clearance progresses. New shapefiles of these \u0026lsquo;hazard polygons\u0026rsquo; are issued by the MACCA on a regular basis, and mineclearance organisations can use these to assess the situation of mineclearance in their areas of operation. DDG is trialling the use of QGIS within the organization to replace the expensive commercial softwares it has used in the past.\nDigital elevation models allow DDG to get an idea of the location of a minefield The use of geospatial data is most useful in the planning and survey phases. In Afghanistan, security problems and rugged terrain mean that physical re-survey of known sites is not always easy. Instead, the use of a mixture of data — satellite or aerial photography underlays, digitized Soviet-era topographic maps, hazard shapefiles and digital elevation models — allow DDG to get an idea of the location of a minefield in relation to the terrain and surrounding natural and physical features before sending in a survey team. QGIS plugins add useful capabilities, like the ability to visualise terrain in 3D. The attached screenshot above — made using the plugin Qgis2threejs —— shows an area just south of the Darulaman Palace in Kabul, with active minefields (along the ridgelines on the left) shown in red over a Soviet topographic raster layer combined with SRTM data. Minefields already cleared show as light green.\nActive hazardous areas shown in red. Hazardous areas already cleared show as light green. Kabul University\u0026rsquo;s campus is still contaminated with suspected hazardous areas — thought to comprise of air-dropped bombs or similar ordnance. While not posing any immediate threat to students or staff, these hazards will require eventual clearance to allow future construction within an educational institution vital to Afghanistan\u0026rsquo;s future development. The hazards are also notable as among the last significant remaining hazardous areas in the Kabul metropolitan area. By using QGIS to combine the hazard polygons from earlier surveys with highly accurate aerial photography provided by the USGS, discrepancies can be noted — e.g. where the polygons do not match the shape of the buildings, as evident in the northwest part of the campus —— which can direct survey teams to places to first conduct a more accurate re-survey.\nQGIS also syncs well with data collected from field operations using handheld Garmin GPS, allowing clearance maps to be made with the locations of mines found and destroyed.\nThe use of QGIS, along with a renewed interest in data analysis, has spurred new ways of looking at the data available, and combining it with other data sources to better target mineclearance activities. It is also driving improved mapping capabilities within the organisation, and an ability to better communicate the impact of its work to international donors. In a part of the world where \u0026lsquo;formal\u0026rsquo; GIS training is difficult to acquire, the collaborative nature of the QGIS user community is greatly appreciated, as technical problems can often be solved by consulting online forums. In short, QGIS is playing a role in working towards ridding Afghanistan of landmines and UXO.\nLink ¶ Danish Demining Group http://www.danishdemininggroup.dk/ Author ¶ Edward Crowther Edward Crowther is Deputy Country Director at Danish Demining Group Afghanistan.

","permalink":"https://qgis.org/download/","tags":null,"title":"Download"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Environmental Policy ¶ Rationale ¶ Environmental issues, such as the climate crisis, the rapid decrease of biodiversity, and pollution are pressing issues for everyone in the Geoscience community and beyond. Many QGIS users and contributors are geoscientists or geoinformatics specialists. As such, we need to act responsibly and serve as role models. If we act, there is a chance that the members of the general public that are less informed about these issues will also feel the urgency to act and help reduce the impact of human activity on our planet.\nPolicy ¶ QGIS.ORG and the QGIS community are committed to act responsibly regarding their actions and activities where it has any relevant influence on the environment. This includes mainly our server infrastructure and our physical contributor meetings.\nServer infrastructure ¶ The infrastructure provider should run the QGIS.ORG infrastructure with renewable energy. Rented server or cloud resources should be sized according to their expected load. Oversizing of infrastructure resources should be avoided.\nPhysical contributor meetings ¶ Choice of location: ​when choosing the location for a contributor meeting, the remoteness of the location of the contributor meeting should be factored in. Very remote places where the majority of participants have to fly to should be avoided.\n*Traveling to the meeting:*​ when feasible, participants should be encouraged to choose more environmentally friendly transport options: preferably trains or buses rather than planes. When choosing transport by car, car pooling should be encouraged. QGIS.ORG has a program allowing contributor meeting participants to ask for travel expenses reimbursement. Efforts to travel with a low-impact means of transportation will be taken into account for travel grant decisions. Conditions for reimbursement of plane tickets :\nno reimbursement if alternative train rides with a travel time \u0026lt;= 10 hours exist (12 hours when including a night train connection), even if the train ticket costs more than the airfare.\nWhen the air travel option has to be chosen and the traveller is claiming travel cost reimbursements, the traveller should pay extra for a carbon offset through an accredited carbon offset company. QGIS.ORG will also reimburse this extra cost.\nSample organizations who offer carbon offset: MyClimate, Atmosfair or other comparable organizations.\nRemote participation: For participants who cannot attend in person, QGIS.org encourages meeting\u0026rsquo;s organizers to enable remote participation through scheduled discussions and video conferencing.\nCatering: Local organizers should organize the catering in an environmentally friendly way as much as possible. Local food should be preferred over food that requires significant transportation. Reusable tableware, cups and cutlery should be preferred over disposable single-use options as they are generally considered to be more friendly to the environment. Meeting attendees should be encouraged to bring their own drinking bottle and event organisers should be requested to promote using potable water from the water mains system, or if that is not suitable, a \u0026lsquo;drinking fountain\u0026rsquo; that can be used to fill up water containers without generating large amounts of plastic waste.\nSmoking and e-cigarettes: second-hand intake of nicotine-based products are hazardous to health and create an unpleasant environment for non-consumers when done near them. Be respectful and do not use these products in doorways or other common areas outside where non-smokers gather. Organizers should rather provide a designated smoking area and request that smokers and e-cigarette users refrain from smoking elsewhere.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/environmental-policy/","tags":null,"title":"Environmental Policy"},{"categories":null,"contents":" FAQ ¶ Here we collect answers to question that come up very often.\nWe will start of with this one page, maybe restructure it into sections, or even more pages if needed\nUser ¶ Downloading issues ¶ If you are trying to download QGIS and nothing seems to happen, please consult the download manager of your browser. It can usually be found as an icon (based on arrow, stop-watch or pie-chart) at the top-right corner of your browser window. Click on the icon to see the download progress or cancel the download. The normal procedure with downloads in the browser is such, that it first asks you where to save the file (with a file browser dialogue) and then you have to wait until the download is finished. Because QGIS install packages can be rather large, depending on the operating system, you have to be patient. The download size can be anywhere between several hundred megabytes to sometimes more than one gigabyte (in case of MS Windows MSI packages). Depending on your download speed and the QGIS server load, downloads can take from several minutes up to several hours.\nI have to donate in order to download QGIS ¶ This is a misconception that we hear from time to time, but it is not true. Donating to QGIS is optional. After downloading QGIS, there is a message appearing, reminding that you can optionally donate to QGIS. However, you can press \u0026ldquo;Close this message\u0026rdquo; and continue downloading without any problem. We want QGIS to be accessible to anyone, no matter how your financial situation might be. If you are a first-time QGIS user, we recommend that you download, install and test QGIS first and find out if the software is useful for the tasks you want to solve. Only if you like QGIS and it substantially helps with your business, tasks or processes, you should think about donating towards QGIS or supporting it as a sustaining member.\nHow to ask a QGIS question? ¶ If you are going to ask a QGIS related question via the mailing lists, please provide enough information to help others easily understand what your problem is. Without a clear and precise question, it is very hard for anybody to answer, or it just takes too much time because the answer will be a question to you etc etc. You may provide information such as:\npreferably a descriptive title for your email\nwhich QGIS version you used at that moment (exact)\nwhat are you expecting to get\nif applicable, what have you tried and the result you got\nif your question is about something broken, you may also provide:\nwhat exactly is the error (if possible: screendump, stacktrace, copy of error text) which Operating System and version how you installed it (osgeo4w? standalone-installer? own build?) at what time did it break (reinstall, new install, system update, project changes) Keep in mind that the more precise your question is, the quicker and more accurate the answer can be.\n💁 Note ¶ In case of a broken function, you may give a look at QGIS issue tracker before mailing to the list. More information at bug-reporting. How are QGIS release names selected? ¶ After a successful developer meeting in Zurich (Switzerland), we decided that the next release should be related to it. Since then, all releases have been named after locations of our developer meetings.\nHow to cite QGIS? ¶ If you need to cite QGIS in your work or for an assignment, please use the citation style that would be most helpful:\nCite the QGIS project in general\nQGIS.org, %%Y.

The purpose of the OpenOttoman (Amy Singer, OpenOttoman: A Collaborative Platform for Digital Scholarship, https://networks.hnet.org/node/11419/discussions/166360/openottoman-collaborative-platform-digital-scholarship, 2017) is to stimulate generation of such materials and provide open and convenient access to these materials. The OpenOttoman Portal (http://www.openottoman.org) (OOP) is one vehicle for accessing these materials. Materials made available through the OOP include databases, with a prime example being gazetteers of Ottoman world places. Here, we describe the Historical Gazetteer of the Crimea (HGC), a prototype OOP gazetteer that includes populated places, districts, and provinces of Crimea in existence at the end of the Crimean Khanate.\nThe primary source of data for the HGC databases is Jankowski\u0026rsquo;s dictionary of pre-Russian places in Crimea (Henryk Jankowski, Historical-Etymological Dictionary of Pre-Russian Habitation Names of the Crimea, Brill, Leiden, 2006). This source contains a map showing the locations of 137 populated places, 99 of which have been associated with existing places contained in the GeoNames database. These are the populated place entries in the HGC, with latitude and longitude for these entries being taken from the GeoNames database.\nJankowski\u0026rsquo;s map also shows boundaries for six provinces and 43 districts. HGC locations for these features are region centroids approximated using boundaries shown on Jankowski\u0026rsquo;s map. The HGC contains entries for 14 of the 16 rivers shown on Jankowski\u0026rsquo;s map plus 61 additional rivers included to aid in locating populated places and district and province boundaries.\nTerrain elevation data (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, available at https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/SRTM1Arc) was incorporated into a base map of the region covered by Jankowski\u0026rsquo;s map. District and province boundaries were approximated using Jankowski\u0026rsquo;s map plus terrain features such as rivers, ridge lines, and valleys where boundaries on Jankowski\u0026rsquo; map were difficult to trace. Gazetteer locations for rivers are river mouth latitude and longitude taken from the GeoNames database. Per Table 1, the HGC includes three separate sets of databases which can be accessed at http://epublications.marquette.edu/ottoman_crimea/. This website also provides access to a project named HGC-QGIS-Project.qgs. Opening the project in QGIS yields the result shown in Figure 1. For the KML and shape file rivers databases, rivers were traced in QGIS using the Google Maps physical map.\nTable 1: Gazetteer databases Opening the project in QGIS yields the result shown in Figure 1. For the KML and shape file rivers databases, rivers were traced in QGIS using the Google Maps physical map.\nFigure 1: HGC-QGIS-Project.qgs opened in QGIS. Table 2 shows the HGC database fields. Note the manner in which a unique ID is assigned to each place in the database. Since each Jankowski place is associated with a place in the GeoNames database, and since each place in the GeoNames database has a unique ID given as a URL, the GeoNames URL for the place serves as a unique identifier for the HGC place.\nTable 2: HGC database fields. Note that the ID can be opened in a web browser, thereby automatically displaying a GeoNames map with the populated place at its center, as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: Opening the URL ID for Qarağy in a web browser. Per Table 2, the fields for the district, province, and river databases are the same as the fields for populated places except that the Page field is left blank, since districts, provinces, and rivers do not appear as entries in Jankowski\u0026rsquo;s dictionary. Districts, provinces, and rivers are assigned URL IDs in the same way that they are assigned for populated places. Thus, in Table 2 the Part of field for the populated place Qarağy is the GeoNames URL for Tarɣan, the district in which this place is located. The Code and Class fields use the nomenclature employed in the GeoNames database. Per the example, the P code applies generally to populated places, and the PPLH class (sub-code) applies to historical populated places that no longer exists.\nThe Confidence field reflects the confidence level of the data captured in a particular database entry. Because all populated places in the HGC can be associated with existing places in the GeoNames database, they are assigned a confidence level of 1. Rivers are also assigned a confidence level of 1, since they have been traced directly from Google Maps.\nWhile providing a useful gazetteer, a primary purpose of the HGC was to serve as a test bed and use case for how other Ottoman world gazetteers could be incorporated into the OOP. Based on experience gained through this project, a new project has been initiated to geolocate approximately 3,000 populated places, rivers, river fords, rapids, islands, forests, mountains, and valleys found on a set of 17th century maps of Ukraine produced by Guillaume Le Vasseur, sieur de Beauplan. This project directly supports one of the principal investigator\u0026rsquo;s research on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth /Ottoman Empire frontier. More generally, this work responds to the need for gazetteers of the Ottoman world as expressed by the OpenOttoman initiative (http://openottoman.org).\nAuthors ¶ Figure 3: Michael and Mark Polczynski\nMichael and Mark Polczynski Michael Polczynski (Michael.Polczynski@georgetown.edu) lectures at Georgetown University, where his work focuses on early modern Ottoman and East/Central European history, frontier history, historical geography, diplomacy, and intellectual history. Michael also studies Late Medieval Eurasian history and 19th century European Emigres in the Ottoman Empire and works extensively with historical GIS and manage several on-line academic communities.\nMark Polczynski (mark.polczynski@marquette.edu) is retired from Marquette University\u0026rsquo;s College of Engineering, and currently provides technical assistance to the OpenOttoman (openottoman.org), a developing transnational digital collaborative for scholarship and public history focused on the Ottoman world.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/case-studies/usa_polczynski/","tags":null,"title":"Historical Gazetteer of the Crimea"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Infrastructure ¶ This page should show you all the infrastructure and services that QGIS uses, and current contacts or owners.\n💭 I think ¶ It is not wise to put accountnames here, but let me know if that is better.

Once you have the installer, no internet is required to complete the installation. When a new release is available, you need to download the complete installer again in order to upgrade. For beginners, the standlone installer is probably the easiest way to install QGIS:\nRelease Version Package Latest Release 3.38.1 Grenoble Installer Checksum Long Term Release 3.34.9 Prizren LTR Installer Checksum Development 3.39 master Weekly snapshots The weekly snapshots of the nightly qgis-dev package of OSGeo4W are for users that cannot use OSGeo4W (see below) for some reason or just prefer standalone installers. In the feature freeze phase, theset also act as release candidate installers.\nOSGeo4W installer ¶ More advanced QGIS users should use OSGeo4W packages. This installer makes it possible to install several versions of QGIS in parallel and also to do much more efficient updates as only changed components are downloaded and installed with each new release.\nThe OSGeo4W repository contains a lot of software from OSGeo projects. QGIS and all dependencies are included, along with Python, GRASS, GDAL, etc. The installer is able to install from internet or just download all needed packages beforehand. The downloaded files are kept in a local directory for future installations and could also be used to install offline.\nInstallation steps are:\nDownload OSGeo4W Installer and run it.\nChoose Express Install and select QGIS to install the latest release and/or QGIS LTR to install the long term release.\nAlternatively, instead of doing the Express install, you can use the Advanced Install, navigate to the Desktop section and pick one or more of the following packages:\nRelease Version Package Description Latest Release 3.38.1 Grenoble qgis Release qgis-rel-dev [1] Nightly build of the upcoming point release Long Term Release 3.34.9 Prizren LTR qgis-ltr Release qgis-ltr-dev [1] Nightly build of the upcoming long term point release Development 3.39 master qgis-dev [1] Nightly build of the development version [1] Nightlies are debug builds (including debugging output that can be used by developers to better understand issues with the build).\nThe packages listed in the above table only install the necessary dependencies needed to run QGIS. Corresponding to those packages there are also meta packages with the suffix -full-free and -full. The -full-free contains additional optional dependencies that some popular (not included in the default QGIS install) plugins use. The -full includes everything from -full-free and also adds proprietary extensions like Oracle drivers, ECW and MrSID.\nThe Express installs reference the corresponding -full variant and the standalone installers are also made from these OSGeo4W package sets.\nBefore installing any of the nightly builds note the warnings below.\nLinux ¶ Most linux distributions split QGIS into several packages; you’ll probably need qgis and qgis-python (to run plugins). Packages like qgis-grass (or qgis-plugin-grass), qgis-server can be skipped initially, or installed only when you need them.\nBelow you will find specific instructions per distribution. For most distro’s there are instructions to install QGIS stable and instructions to install a cutting edge QGIS testing build (note the warning).\nDebian/Ubuntu ¶ Quickstart ¶ 💁 Note ¶ In the section following this one, you will find ALL possible options to install different versions of QGIS in different versions of Debian/Ubuntu. If you have problems, verify whether your distribution is still supported as the repositories also contain older unsupported distributions with the last QGIS version that was supported. Be aware that those might have meanwhile ceased to work. Simply install the latest stable QGIS (3.38.x Grenoble) in your Debian or Ubuntu without having to edit config files.\n🌀 Note ¶ Although you see ‘Debian’ in some places, this also works for ‘Ubuntu’, as one is actually a symlink to the other on our server. First install some tools you will need for these instructions:\nsudo apt install gnupg software-properties-common Now install the QGIS Signing Key, so QGIS software from the QGIS repo will be trusted and installed:\nsudo mkdir -m755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings # not needed since apt version 2.4.0 like Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22 or newer sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg https://download.qgis.org/downloads/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg Add the QGIS repo for the latest stable QGIS (3.38.x Grenoble) to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.sources:\nTypes: deb deb-src URIs: https://qgis.org/debian Suites: your-distributions-codename Architectures: amd64 Components: main Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg 💬 Note ¶ Suites in above lines depends on your distribution. lsb_release -cs will show your distribution name.\nIn some distributions (like Linux Mint), . /etc/os-release; echo \u0026quot;$UBUNTU_CODENAME\u0026quot; will show the correct distibution name.\nSee Available codenames. Update your repository information to also reflect the newly added QGIS one:\nsudo apt update Now, install QGIS:\nsudo apt install qgis qgis-plugin-grass ✍️ Note ¶ Add qgis-server to the above line if you also want to install QGIS Server Repositories ¶ Default Debian and Ubuntu software repositories often contain older versions of QGIS.\nTo have newer versions, you have to add alternative software repositories, by adding one of the deb-lines below to your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.sources file.\nOur main repository contains multiple lines of packages for several versions of Debian and Ubuntu based on the dependencies the individual distributions provide.\nFor Ubuntu we also used to have extra packages in a separate repository that are based on ubuntugis, which held more up-to-date versions of other GIS packages than Ubuntu itself for LTS versions. If you want those you also need to include ubuntugis-unstable ppa in your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.list file (see ubuntugis documentation).\n💁 Note ¶ The release packages are only produced once, shortly after a new version has been released. As unstable, not yet released debian versions (testing) and ubuntugis-unstable can have library changes the packages might sooner or later be broken for these targets, when the development in debian, ubuntu or ubuntugis-unstable moves on and their packages used as dependencies in QGIS change. In that event you can either:\nmove to a stable debian version and use the released packages for it,\nwait for the next point release (due 2024-08-16 12:00:00 UTC), which happens every month and will include the updated dependencies,\nswitch to a nightly repository (available for the two release branches and master) whose packages are rebuild on regular basis and will also pickup the updated dependencies automatically or\nbuild your own set of packages (see build-debian-packages).

In the module \u0026lsquo;Applied GIS in Natural Resource Management\u0026rsquo;, under the guidance of Prof. Mund, the students quickly discovered the subject\u0026rsquo;s complexity, especially within regard to the adaptability of species to changing environments. With limited research published in English about lynx habitat on the Romanian side, we continued the project based on only freely available data sets and open-source software, aiming to establish conceptual knowledge of habitat modeling, strengthening skills on widely applied QGIS tools and to create a basic expert model in the process.\nMethodology ¶ All collected data was processed with QGIS 2.6 and 2.8, projected into ETRS89 / ETRS-LAEA and stored according to the INSPIRE directive to meet EU standards. An overall discrete index of weights was defined and applied to all input data.\nFigure 1: Workflow - Lynx habitat expert model Workflow description\nArea of Interest [Step I \u0026ndash; II]: Based on selected national park areas and adding a 10 kilometer buffer, a minimum bounding box [α] was created and clipped with the outline of the river Danube (derived from Corine Land Cover 2006). Further clipping tools [β] were applied to all additional data as an initial preparation step (Figure 2) Land Cover Suitability Model [Step IX]: [γ] Input III and IV were transformed into shape files using the inbuilt #Polygonize function. Corine Landcover (2006) data was reclassified using the field calculator to group land use classes and assign respective index values. Similar processing was applied to Hansen Forestcover data (2000), extracting only areas of cover equal or higher 75 %. Sub-model IX was produced by using the functions #Merge Shapes to combine III with IV and #Rasterize Note: Land cover classes were grouped by possible lynx occurrence and human activity. Although technically of older origin, information related to forest cover values were integrated in order to indicate habitat improvement and as a general example for joining spatial data sets\nHabitat Suitability Model [Step X]: [δ] An Elevation Suitability Index was derived from the AsterDEM 2.0 [VI] and together with a Population Density Index [V] was integrated into the final habitat suitability model (Figure 3) by using the #Raster calculator Cover Suitability Model * Population Density Index * Elevation Suitability Index Note:Defining forest (\u0026gt;= 75 % cover) as best suitable and using the elevation data to reduce index values above assumed tree line is conceptually related to habitat of deer as the main prey\nPotential Hunter Accessibility Model [Step XI]: Applying the #Terrain analysis tool [ε], a slope layer was extracted from the DEM data and combined [η] with a road distance layer, which was produced by processing rasterized OSM road data within the #Proximity function and index values assigned using #Reclassify grid values Slopelayer Road distance * ( 1 + ----------- ) 100 Conservation Value Model [Step XII]: Is the result of the #Raster calculator function: (Figure 4) (Habitat Suitability Model * Hunter Accessibility Model) -------------------------------------------------------- 2 Note: The Hunter Accessibility Model shall indicate the decreasing likelihood of hunters accessing the area by further distance to roads and increasing slope\nFigure 2, 3 and 4 Conclusion ¶ Looking at the final output (Figure 3), a plausible first potential habitat analysis appeared to be successful, yet more importantly, basic modeling itself turned out to be less difficult than initially expected. Our choice to add a sub-model for hunter accessibility allowed us to implement another dimension in terms of habitat risk assessment, which can be simply nested into the already existing scenario and used to determine protection necessities under aspects of e.g. infrastructure development. However, some crucial habitat information, such as forest structure (our highest habitat suitability) cannot be derived by available data sets and in combination with the complex species behavior, the result must therefore be understood as basic and incomplete. Additional factors not implemented at this stage are road mortality, terrain roughness and detailed prey occurrence.\nBesides its open source, free available character, QGIS software has been the subject of major developments in recent years. We made very positive experience with the integration of the tool box, allowing the use of various GRASS and SAGA tools, even for inexperienced users. No compatibility issues occurred despite changing frequently between different versions and the general absence of administrative restrictions can be a powerful advantage when working intuitively with data sets. We are looking forward seeing further improvements, especially in regards to the integrated model builder.\nReferences ¶ Kaczensky, P., Chapron, G.,von Avrx, M., Huber, D., Andrén, H. \u0026amp; Linnell, J.

It is often difficult to design proper environmental protection because the common sources of data may be a state secret or may not even exist. Frequently, we are asked to do designs without proper survey data. In addition there is usually not enough time for a proper study. My background is in Urban Planning with a minor in Environmental Science.\nThe task was plan a conservation park on the Chinese side of the Ili River which supplies 80% of the water to Lake Balkhash. FOSS GIS application + FOSS GIS data stores + FOSS GIS education were all critical to reconstruct and model the Hydrological and Ecological processes necessary for authentic conservation planning. As a non-scientist with no prior training or experience I could not have done it without all three. My company did not and would not pay to purchase GIS software to run the industry standard arcHYDRO.\nStory ¶ With some trial and error I was able to produce an arcHYDRO like output from QGIS. Beginning with a USGS Hydrosheds DEM which was converted into a Regularized Spline with Tension using the GRASS functions inside QGIS and training by Helena Mitsova. The RST surface was analyzed this surface to find the catchments and flow paths, and resulting vector topologies were cleaned up in QGIS to generate the Hydrologic network and also to build up the attribute tables.\nThis network was ranked by r.stream extension in GRASS to build Hortons and Hacks stream ordering. Then a distance to outlet surface grid was generated and analyzed by zonal statistics to find the farthest point. Next, r.drain in GRASS to trace a time of concentration line. Finally v.net in GRASS was used to build a network of pour points, flow paths, TOC paths, and HMDP for each watershed. In this workflow, the QGIS tool attribute by location was invaluable.\nAfter the basic hydrologic network was finished I used UN FAO soils database with table joins to classify soils. Then using query functions in QGIS the FAO soils were converted to USDA soils. A previously downloaded USGS ETM7+ grid was classified with the i.cluser and r.maxlik in GRASS into a NLCD grid. By using reclassification tables I converted the landcover to Manning's n-value grid for overland flow. Finally I wrote a lookup table in r.mapcalc and merged the soil and landcover grids into and NRCS TR-55 curve numbers following the arcHYDRO methodology.\nTo create the rainfall grids I performed statistical analysis on GHCN tables to find rainfall depths for design storms of 1,2,5,10,50,100 year returns. Then I downloaded a free sample grid of PRISM for China and assuming a linear relationship, converted average cell values to maximum cell values in order to build maximum rainfall intensity grids.\nConclusion ¶ I began using QGIS out of desperation for lack of arcMAP but now I never want to go back. The investment of time in FOSS is worthwhile because you can take it with you to any job. The combination of GRASS QGIS PostGIS gives you the full functionality of expensive GIS systems. The online learning resources provided were as valuable as the actual software. I was able to learn QGIS fast enough to produce a great project in a fast based real world industry environment.\nAuthor ¶ Robert Ward Robert Ward is an Urban Designer and GIS Analyst at Parsons Brinkerhoff working at the intersection of high technology and high art.

Changing demands upon the forest and the poor financial situation of forest enterprises in Switzerland led to the development of a new forestry planning concept about fifteen years ago. This concept introduced a clear distinction between planning at the level of the authorities and planning at the level of the owners1. As a new forestry planning office, guaraci works primarily in the region of Basel (Switzerland) on both mentioned planning levels. This case study discusses the use of QGIS at the forest owner level. On this level, a simple, dynamic and compatible geographic information system is required for the establishment of a forest management plan. This plan covers about 1000 ha of forests, will be valid for about 20 years and is implemented by the local forest manager. The area is situated in the region of Basel (see google maps).\nHow QGIS was used ¶ Within the whole planning process QGIS was used for the following four tasks:\nImport of existing data. The data includes geo-referenced background maps (*.tif) along with polygon, line and point shape files. For the forest manager, the visualization of existing thematic data (for example ground- and drinking water resources, nature protection zones) are important for his daily work. Digitizing. The forestry measurements planned by the forest manager had been digitized. The QGIS digitizing tools with the advanced snapping options are very useful and user friendly. The „delimited text\u0026quot; plugin enabled the import of additional data tables. Analysis. The areas of the different measurement categories had been calculated. Starting from certain line features such as train tracks or roads, corresponding protection forests were determined with the help of a buffer. Print and export. The print composer supported the map layout creation. The map was exported as PDF and image files. Extract of the forestry measurements map Conclusion ¶ QGIS is an interesting tool for small planning offices, such as guaraci, as well as for the forest managers and owners. It can be used in a professional context and the presented output result was appreciated by all parties involved. For the mentioned tasks the present QGIS version 1.4 \u0026ldquo;Enceladus\u0026rdquo; offers all necessary GIS tools. The most important qualities of QGIS are the intuitive user interface and the compatibility with different file formats. It is an ideal tool for projects that are on one hand based on existing geographic data and on the other hand require the acquisition of new data. The user-manual is helpful and easy to understand. Both from the technical as well as the financial perspective QGIS is an interesting alternative to other GIS software.\nPerspective ¶ The core tasks of a forestry planning concept can be worked out with the mentioned basic GIS tools. Guaraci will continue to use QGIS for forestry planning at the forest owner level. Based on the experiences with the presented project, QGIS can also be recommended for forestry concepts at the level of local authorities. Larger, and more complex projects with detailed analysis requirements could be handled by the combination of QGIS with the Postgis spatial database server. New logging zones as well as forest reservates and protection zones can be easily digitized. Hopefully, forest owners and managers will increasingly use the potential of QGIS also for their yearly planning as well as the documentation of their forest activities.\nAuthor ¶ Raphael Häner This article was contributed in June 2010 by Raphael Häner.

To face this risk, the portuguese government, through the National Forest Authority (AFN), decided, a few years ago, to create technical offices allocated to local governments which, among other skills, must prepare Municipal Plans for Forest Fire Protection and Operational Response.\nIn order to support the elaboration of these documents, the AFN provided technical guides with a methodology for calculating and mapping the Forest Fire Hazard and Risk. Moreover, tutorials have been offered to follow this methodology, using Proprietary Software. However, the acquisition and licensing costs of that software are unaffordable for most of the smaller local administrations and so, it was decided to create and make available a guide with a methodology for developing Hazard and Risk cartography using only Free and Open Source Software [http://goo.gl/TSv2E].\nIt was proposed to use the following set of software: QGIS, GRASS GIS, gvSIG and GDAL/OGR libraries. That guide describes all the geoprocessing tasks necessary for the elaboration of the plans for Forest Fire Protection and Operational Response, according to the AFN methodology. A large part of the tasks were developed with QGIS, and spatial analysis in raster model was developed with GRASS. gvSIG was used for network analysis, with its Network Analysis extension, and GDAL/OGR libraries were used for transformations between coordinate reference systems.\nAfter an extensive suite of tests to the methodology, and three years of real application in the preparation of the Operational Plan for the municipality of Pinhel, it can be said that the proposed alternatives allow to replace, with many advantages, Proprietary Software that is usually used to carry out this task. The validation of the results shows that, despite the relative simplicity of the conceptual model, its predictive ability is quite good, and that the model implementation in Open Source Software does not interfere negatively with the results, quite the opposite.\nForest Fire Hazard and Risk Maps of Pinhel, implemented with Open Source Software. In a second phase, it was tried to speed up this process, using models to establish a workflow that perform a wide set of tasks, almost without human intervention. This second stage consisted essentially in the automation of the entire procedure described in practical guide which resulted from the first phase. Such automation could mean a reduction of several hours of intense work on the part of the technician who intends to produce annually Forest Defense Plans, for just a few minutes, in which the human intervention boils down to the selection of input data and the indication of the place where we intend to keep the output data.\nInterface of the Sextante Model to calculate the Probability of the Forest Fire Hazard. In furtherance of this second phase, we used the Python version of Sextante software, that works integrated into QGIS and adds a broad set of independent applications (GRASS GIS, SAGA GIS, OTB, R, GDAL/OGR, Pymorph, LASTools, Python scrips, etc..) in a single interface, providing a huge geoprocessing toolbox to QGIS users. Besides the integration of these applications in QGIS, Sextante has a tool for creating models, taking advantage of the modules offered by any of those softwares which aggregates. So, we've created a model to automate the process of producing Forest Fire Hazard and Risk maps, using GRASS, SAGA, fTools and MMQGIS tools.\nPart of the model developed for automation of the production of cartography for Forest Fire Hazard and Risk. The results obtained so far are very promising, as already can be automatically achieved the creation of the Hazard and Risk Maps [2]. Taking into account that the Python version of Sextante is still very recent and is in heavy construction, there are some problems that must be corrected so that the models may be completed, which certainly will happen very soon, given the momentum that Sextante project presents. As future work, we intend to apply, also automatically, the symbology to the results as well as provide the final layouts in QGIS Composer, ready for export and/or print. Upon completion of the second phase and the realization of a sufficient set of tests that can validate the results obtained, it is our intention to provide the model free and openly.\nConclusions ¶ The alternatives studied proved to be of enormous quality, allowing all operations recommended in the National Forest Authority technical guides, in many ways, more efficiently than with Proprietary Software. In terms of ease of use, it was observed that this type of software is not, in any way, more complex than the proprietary software, requiring only more technical knowledge of the models and algorithms implemented which, however, allow a higher degree of freedom, making possible to explore and fine tune the models to each particular situation. The process of producing Forest Fire Hazard and Risk cartography using, exclusively, Open Source Software is fully consolidated, after several years of testing and application in the municipality of Pinhel.\nThe fact that Open Source Software is based on standards and support most of the open data formats, allows the complete interoperability between software, allowing the user to opt for the most suitable in each moment. Despite our proposal point to a specific set of software, nothing prevents to be replaced by any of the existing alternatives in the wide range of proposals for Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial. However, QGIS increasingly presents itself as the most complete, stable and easy to use FOSS4G solution, and whose project is more dynamic, with rapid correction of bugs and with almost daily implementation of new plugins that adds specific functionalities to the most diverse areas of activities.\nAuthor ¶ Pedro Venâncio Pedro Venâncio B.Sc. in Geology, Postgraduate in Free Software and M.Sc. in Geographic Information Systems.

The project, supported by public and private entities \u0026ndash; mainly the Municipalty, Digiterra.hu and the Army's Geographic Institute (IGeoE), aimed three goals:\nField Survey with Differencial GPS to gather the coordinates of the sites; Build a Risk Model to identify hazards towards paleontological heritage and thus prevent them through regular field surveys; Build a Geographic Database to handle all the information and start the collection inventory. Software we used ¶ QGIS was the mainframe of all the project. Data was dumped directly to QGIS, and then edited and manipulated in order to achieve the desired outputs. The GRASS interface provided by QGIS allowed us to conduct complex spatial analyis on rasters in order to obtain the risk model we needed to plan our field work and future prospection. Furthermore it allowed us to import PostGIS layers and visualize them on QGIS.\nVector point data editing and visualization The choice for QGIS was also encouraged by the multi platform support. The institution has three distinct facilities, and each of those facilities has different systems — we have Mac, Windows PC and Linux PC, therefore it's of extreme importance that we have the freedom to install the software on any machine we want so we don't get stuck to a particular computer.\nPaleontological Risk Map Conclusion ¶ The overall experience with QGIS can only be rated has being very good and recommendable. From our point of view, the main advantage of QGIS is that it's not just a GIS software — it's a productivity suite for spatial data. It allowed us to take advantage of other powerful tools within a single work environment. From QGIS you can work with GRASS, with PostGIS, with GPS data, with webservices and with tens of useful plug-ins developed by users worldwide. The user friendly interface is also a big advantage, especially if you have to train first time users has we've done. The easyness of the interface makes production of maps an everyday task and brought people closer to spatial approaches [3].\nReferences ¶ [1] www.alt-shn.org (portuguese only) [2] MANO, André.

During the last century, it suffered a high regression, being a \u0026ldquo;vulnerable\u0026rdquo; species in Spain and \u0026ldquo;endangered\u0026rdquo; in Portugal. Nowadays, there are only around 300 wolves in Portugal, due to the high persecution, destruction and fragmentation of the habitat.\nStudy area in Portugal Ribeira de Pena is a municipality in the Vila Real district in the north of Portugal. It is a rural municipality, characterized by agriculture, grazing livestock, forest, mountains, valleys and diverse fauna, along with low human density, that provides shelter and food for wolves. Located in a zone of transition between the harsh and mountainous Trás-os-Montes and the verdant Minho, Ribeira de Pena is one of the municipalities that can work like an ecological corridor between areas with higher wolf concentration in the north with lower concentration in the south.\nI started using GIS software during my biology course, and more often during my master thesis. At that time I used mainly proprietary software. After I finished my master degree, I lost access to the proprietary software.\nMeanwhile, I entered in the new world of Linux. After that I was contacted to help some researchers to model ecological corridors for wolves in Ribeira de Pena, using GIS, since they never worked with this kind of software. Because I was already using Linux instead of windows, my first problem was which software to use. Then I heard about QGIS and decided to give it a try, although it seemed very simplistic and incomplete, when compared to what I already knew. I quickly realized how mistaken I was, and got really enthusiastic with the analytical capabilities QGIS provided, specially with GRASS integration.\nTo model the ecological corridors, we used the QGIS along with the GRASS plugin. We used several geographic information along with presence data of the species to model the ecological corridors. Here are some of the functions of both QGIS and GRASS used in this case, just to name a few:\nplugin Interpolation in QGIS: to create a Digital Elevation Model r.watershed in GRASS: to create water streams from DEM r.grow.distance in GRASS: generates a raster map layer of distance to features in input layer r.reclass in GRASS: to reclassify map layers r.slope.aspect.slope in GRASS: to calculate the slope from the DEM r.mapcalculator in GRASS: to calculate some simple map algebra r.cost.coord in GRASS: creates a raster map showing the cumulative cost of moving between different geographic locations on an input raster map whose cell category values represent cost r.drain in GRASS: Traces a flow through an elevation model on a raster map — the one used to create the corridors With this work we obtained a map with the potential ecological corridors for wolf in Ribeira de Pena municipality. These are areas to be considered by the city council technicians when planning conservation measures for the species. These corridors are of extreme importance because they can connect the fragile wolf packs in Vila Real in the south with those in the north, which are continuous with those from Peneda-Gerês and Spain far more stable. It is from particular importance those corridors that cross human settlements, like small villages, cities and roads. These areas must be considered critical for wolf conservation, and applied measures to reduce human impact in this species.\nEcological corridors and critical conservation areas for wolves in northern Portugal. Conclusion ¶ Both QGIS and plugin GRASS are very intuitive with user-friendly interface, with all essential functions to perform most analysis. For what I could see, QGIS and GRASS perform equally as well as the proprietary programs I was most familiar with from college days, with the big advantage of free open-source software, usable in every computer or notebook without licenses, constant upgrades and the ultimate advantage to contribute to it's improvement and/or tip the developers about some essential function.\nChanging to Linux and then to QGIS and GRASS was one of my best calls, and although there can be some missing issues, easily resolved in the future with the developers, I don't regret my decision and advise everyone to use them.\nAuthor ¶ Monica Almeida This article was contributed in July 2012 by Monica Almeida.

Through my graduate internship, PhD work and two other research jobs, I used the proprietary software packages that were available and used at my workplaces — mainly CartaLinx, Idrisi, ArcView and ArcGIS. But I found it rather annoying that we were constantly dealing with license renewal issues, and that I could not use the software away from the workplace unless I acquired my own license.\nDistribution of Spanish algyroides (Algyroides marchi) at three spatial scales and from two different data sources. It crossed my mind on several occasions that switching to free software would spare me those problems. However, there was prejudice against the analytical capabilities of free software, and even after I heard about the potential of GRASS, I was still reluctant because I thought it would be too difficult to learn. I was also afraid it would be cumbersome to migrate all the maps and analyses that I had done so far. At the beginning of my post-doc in 2008, I finally gave it an opportunity and took a training course on QGIS and GRASS. It was probably the best decision of my professional life! I found that QGIS provided a very intuitive interface for GRASS, hat they complemented each other perfectly, and they provided all the analytical capabilities I needed.\nI started using both programs immediately after the course. Not only did I begin all my new GIS work with QGIS/GRASS [e.g. 1, 2], but I also did follow-up analyses on previous works that I had done with commercial software. For example, I had built models of otter [3] and desman [4] distribution in the Iberian Peninsula. After switching to QGIS-GRASS, I analysed how those models behaved when downscaled to a finer resolution [5]. Another previous work on biogeographic relationships between Iberian lynx and rabbit [6] had a follow-up after I switched to QGIS-GRASS [7]. Not only did I not have any problems with the migration of the data and previous results: I also found it much easier to do the things I wanted to do with the new software, and was able to do extra analyses which I could not have done with the programs I used before.\nEnvironmental suitability for the Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) together with presence, absence, and random points in north Catalonia (Spain). Conclusion ¶ All in all, switching to QGIS/GRASS brought me nothing but advantages. I can now work freely at work, at home and on my laptop on the move, without having to worry about software licenses or moving to new institutions. Open-source software covers all my research needs and gives me the freedom I longed for.\nReferences ¶ [1] Barbosa A.M., Fontaneto D., Marini L. \u0026amp; Pautasso M.

The council region, mainly the southern part, suffers from major bushfires. Bushfire is a real and present concern for the residents and landowners in the Southern Downs Region, and has resulted in the loss of life and property.\nThis project will allow the council and the people of the region to be more aware of the risk and to allow for better decision making in the future.\nThe Project ¶ As bushfire is not only a problem for SDRC but also for the whole of Queensland, the state government requires that each local government identifies the bushfire hazard in their area via the State Planning Policy 1/03 Mitigating the Adverse Impacts of Flood, Bushfire and Landslide [1]. This kind of job would normally be done using consultants but was instead done by the council itself using a combination of QGIS and GRASS.\nThe GIS side of the project project was broken down into 6 main steps\nSlope assessment and mapping Aspect assessment and mapping Vegetation assessment and mapping Combining scores to identify the severity of bushfire hazard Field verification and qualitative assessment Final Maps The use of QGIS and GRASS ¶ QGIS, using the GRASS plugin, was selected as it provided the tools needed to complete the job and the interaction between QGIS and GRASS made it easy to process the raster maps and present them in a meaningful way to users. SDRC uses MapInfo for its main GIS system, however MapInfo\u0026rsquo;s addons were not as powerful as GRASS GIS for raster processing.\nThe QGIS GRASS plugin was used to import 5 meter contours of the whole region into GRASS which were then converted into a contour raster map using r.surf.contour. A slope and aspect map were then generated using r.slope.aspect from the raster contour map. Categories were assigned to different slope and aspect ranges and given a hazard risk sore. Vegetation areas were also given different risk scores. All the resulting raster maps were then combined using mapcalc and given a final risk hazard score. The risk scores are then divided into three main categories: high; medium; and low.\nThe final part of the process was field verification via the rural fire service. After the review process, QGIS was used to print the final maps for presentation.\nAs all GRASS commands can be run from the command line, all the commands that were needed to generate the bushfire hazard maps were recorded, for documentation purposes and for if the maps needed to be regenerated some time in the future.\nConclusion ¶ Overall QGIS, together with the GRASS plugin, provided a great experience and a great final outcome for the council doing their own bushfire hazard mapping. The GRASS plugin provides a very easy to use interface to GRASS through QGIS. As QGIS is able to open the GRASS raster format natively, integration is very seamless and maps can be made with ease.\nThe project won an encouragement award at the Queensland Planning Institute of Australia state planning awards in 2010 [2]\nReferences ¶ [1] http://www.emergency.qld.gov.au/publications/spp/ [2] http://digital.crowtherblayne.com.au/default.aspx?xml=crowther_pia.xml Author ¶ Nathan Woodrow This article was contributed in January 2011 by Nathan Woodrow.

In Brno, Czech Republic (Vysoká škola obchodní a hotelová, s.r.o.) which offers higher education at tourism, business and hotel management. LEAG is focused on modeling socio-economic spatial processes, analyzing spatial patterns, describing and monitoring the reality of localities and regions.\nQGIS while modeling 3D objects (interpolation), terrain analysis LEAG plays important role in academic research held in College of Business and Hotel Management. The need of spatial modeling requires also excellent software. The philosophy of minimum cost and maximum efficiency led to choice of open source solutions. This step resulted in using core open source SW such as LibreOffice, GIMP, Inkscape and QGIS. QGIS does not stand alone — we use MapWindow, OpenJump, gvSIG, SAGA and others. But QGIS plays the major role.\nUse of QGIS ¶ QGIS is the leading software and stands in current versions (because of the \u0026ldquo;experimental\u0026rdquo; character of LEAG we are using the latest unstable releases instead of LTS versions) for several reasons:\nGraphical User Interface (close to commercial products) Quick development and integrating user-wanted features Stability and interoperability (we are using Windows and Ubuntu Linux platforms) Others (mentioned e.g. in the case study written by Dr. Horst Düster) Spatial analysis are done mainly using basic geoprocessing functions and Python-based plugins. Recent projects where QGIS was used:\nModeling patterns between spatial location and inhabitants Creating 3D models for terrain visualization (and further use as hill-shadowing) Storing, creating and editing database of small and medium enterprises (+ further visualization) Homogenizing of free-to-use geodata and creation of \u0026ldquo;geo-data-bank\u0026rdquo; for students and researchers at College of Business and Hotel Management QGIS is used with synergy to other open source products. For example the final layout is mostly create using Inkscape or GIMP (less in LibreOffice Draw). Web-based maps are editing using Inkscape (after SVG export) and raster maps are pre-edited using GIMP.\nQGIS is also great educational tool. College of Business and Hotel Management offers students subjects like \u0026ldquo;Geographical Information Systems I. and II.\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Selected chapters from geoinformatic literacy\u0026rdquo; where QGIS is used as main platform for teaching students how to use GIS and how to produce high-quality maps. Recently, the QGIS was used as main product during GIS Day held at our school on November 2010.\nUsing diagrams comparing population between two censuses Conclusion ¶ With no cost and high efficiency the Laboratory on Experimental and Applied Geography produces high-quality analysis, maps and visualizations. Using QGIS large databases are being created and further testing of new functions are being done. Finally, one of the highest impact of using QGIS could be seen in education —— QGIS is the first software, which is presented to students. During regular workshops students learn how to legally work with QGIS and how to create their own maps.\nAuthor ¶ Jakub Trojan This article was contributed in November 2010 by Jakub Trojan.

The case of the urban green spaces in Rada Tilly coastal town analyzed by QGIS, tends to demonstrate a methodology of an academic exercise that can project, with important reaches, as formative instances related to the geographical reasoning in students of 12th grade of the Abraham Lincoln School.\nWe started by the observation (inventory), digitizing the cadastral blocks and the green areas (tree´s canopy) using Google Earth satellite images. As a conceptual framework, we lectured about cartographic design, satellite images reading and interpretation, and specially, location analysis to contrast the situation (in m^2^) of the urban green spaces by inhabitant in Rada Villa coastal town, with values suggested by the World Health Organization, WHO (a minimum of 9 m^2^ of green areas, by person, in urban areas).\nAbout the project ¶ The main objective of the experience was to lecture the 12th grade students, in the implementation of a GIS as tool to optimize and enhance the management of spatial information, and to provide a support to the decision making process.\nSpecific objectives:\nStudent´s appropriation of a local issue (the Rada Tilly´s green areas related the 9 m^2^ by inhabitant proposed by WHO) from a geographical perspective through GIS tools. Usage of GIS as a technical tool to validate of socio-spatial hypothesis. Verification of the viability of capture, processing, storage, analysis, recovery and updating of spatial data using a FOSS QGIS. Methodology:\nTo generate the project we continue the following methodology:\nPractical and theoretical lectures; mainly about the usage of QGIS and the benefits of urban green spaces and its territorial implications. Cartographic modeling, vector layers definition, development of GIS databases. Field work (trees data records and GPS locations). Vector digitizing of urban cadastral blocks and the tree´s canopies, using a Google Earth (GeoEye) image. In order to consider the amount inhabitants by cadastral block, we assigned an average value of 4 inhabitants by plot. Results presentation through thematic cartography. Attribute table of “blocks” vector layer Conclusion ¶ Based in the projection of an average value of 4 inhabitants by cadastral plot, we estimated that the current (2010) urban population Rada Tilly would go up to around 9.600 inhabitants. These people reside in 209 blocks and they represent 157.6 hectares. The average population density would be of 61 inhabitants by hectare.\nThe total inventoried green areas grow up to 150.736 m^2^ (15 hectares). Reason why we can consider that the green area by inhabitant in the study area is 15.7 m^2^ (the WHO suggested value is 9 m^2^ of green area by inhabitant). This value proves a very favorable situation, as far as the environmental benefits, that trees offer to the inhabitants in this marine coastal town.\nDistribution of urban green spaces (green) and population density by blocks (white to brown) at Rada Tilly coastal town, Chubut Provinc, Argentina. Although the project was an academic exercise of High School, we deeply value the inventory´s results obtained by QGIS. Students worked with all academic rigor and seriousness, showing appropriation of the thematic (urban green spaces) and also of the tool (QGIS). It was a very enriching experience for them and also for the educational staff involved.\nAfter the project experience we can assure that the FOSS QGIS is an extremely recommendable alternative for capture, processing, storage, analysis, recovery and updating of spatial data, in fast and efficient form. We have such a positive impression of the software that we will start the use of QGIS in our university courses, replacing GIS Proprietary software that we have being using.\nAuthors ¶ This article was contributed in September 2011 by Mauro Novara and Alberto Vázquez from Argentina.\nMauro Novara Mauro Novara is Professor of Territorial Information Systems course.

The scope of administration for the department however is limited to Peninsular Malaysia as Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia have their respective town planning agencies. Town and country planning is on the concurrent list in the Federal Legislation, thus, at the federal level, JPBD advises the Housing and Local Government Minister from which JPBD gets its patronage as well as to advise the National Physical Planning Council chaired by the Prime Minister. At the state level, the state director advises the State Planning Committee chaired by the Chief Minister. At the local level, JPBD advises local planning authorities on planning matters by being involved in the preparation of mandatory development plans. At Headquarters, the National Physical Plan Division prepares the National Physical Plan while four regional project offices assist in the preparation of State Structure Plans, District Local Plans and Special Area Plans. As public agencies were traditionally established base on their specialization, JPBD is the custodian of landuse information.\nThe Project ¶ QGIS was first introduced to the Malaysian Open Source community as a viable alternative to proprietary GIS for public agencies by JPBD at the Malaysian Government Open Source Conference (MyGOSSCON) in 2009 and to the Malaysian GIS community at the 4th National GIS Conference and Exhibition (NGIS) in 2010. JPBD has traditionally been a user of proprietary GIS thus the introduction of QGIS was a real eye opener not only from the point-of-view of Open Source Software (OSS), what more, OSS GIS. Open source philosophy was different thus QGIS felt alien, unsure and unsafe, not surprisingly the idea to use QGIS did not receive much support internally, in fact, it faced resistance in 2010 from the top managment all the way down to the support group.\nMyGOSSCON, 2009 On the opposite side, request for technical talks on QGIS came from other technical agencies which JPBD gave to the Ministry of Works and the Department of Irrigation and Drainage. Other works to promote QGIS from JPBD came in the form of newsletter articles on QGIS to the Open Source Competency Centre (OSCC) at the Prime Minister's Department and articles introducing QGIS to the Survey Department's GIS Bulletin and the Ministry of Natural Resource's Public Sector GeoSpatial Bulletin. In the meantime, JPBD researched on developing a slope analysis module for QGIS's Windows and Ubuntu version.\nThe study highlighted pros and cons of customizing a module and the high level of commitment from the management needed to ensure its continual success and adoption. In 2011, JPBD began to further research on QGIS more as an analytical tool rather than a mapping tool in order to pioneer untapped modules or new approaches at exploiting QGIS.\nThe department eventually promoted the QGIS-GRASS package instead of merely QGIS as it was found to be most powerful and helpful for town planning purposes such as cleaning topology error and overcoming limitations of the default standard inputs. That was merely the beginning.\nNorthern Project Office get QGIS training In order to centralize and share findings in the use of QGIS for town planning purpose which could also be use in other fields dealing with spatial analysis, an unofficial blog established by the author called \u0026ldquo;QGIS MALAYSIA\u0026rdquo; at http://www.qgismalaysia.blogspot.com was made to generate a QGIS community in Malaysia. External agencies seem to have more interest in QGIS than JPBD itself and upon their request, JPBD gave QGIS training to the Fire and Safety Department as well as to the Ministry of Education whom later was convinced QGIS will be their de facto GIS tool.\nHearing this, JPBD's Research and Development Division took the initiative and requested for QGIS training and subsequently 12 persons were trained. Word of mouth (a godsend thing, though at times, extremely detrimental) spread that QGIS was indeed user-friendly, easy to use and at par with proprietary GIS in mapping task and could take on proprietary GIS when optimized with GRASS modules.\nInterest in QGIS stirred and in 2012, with the support of all project office directors, an all-out effort was undertaken by the National Landuse Information Division that spearheaded QGIS to train the 4 project offices as they hold the greatest number of GIS users. By the end of 2012, it is anticipated that at least 320 staff throughout JPBD will use QGIS which accounts for approximately 90 % of GIS users in the department.\nThat is not all. States town planning departments have also requested QGIS training such as Perak including strong interest from poorer states like Perlis and Kelantan. If this catches on, it is anticipated that the use of QGIS may dominate states planning departments and even extend to local planning authorities, many of which are not wealthy. In the meantime, JPBD is seriously studying the use of the QGIS-PosgreSQL-PostGIS package for every planning office's client GIS-geodatabase server structure to serve as the foundation of JPBD's integrated landuse (iPLAN) network.\nOutcome from using QGIS ¶ On the assumption of RM10,000 per proprietary GIS licence, the use of 320 QGIS installations will help save the federal government RM3,200,000; A total eradication of pirate GIS and increasing trust and confidence in the use of OSS in general and specifically OSS GIS; QGIS training has been simplier to manage. This means cross-learning between staff, divisions, public agencies and even local planning authorities that use QGIS can be more effective because the GIS used is uniform; The use of QGIS helps towards synergy with a PostgreSQL-PostGIS geodatabase which the department is planning to use as the foundation of landuse geodatabase throughout Peninsular Malaysia. It has been faster to process data verification and clean topology error. Users become more courageous and begin to venture into Google Maps and other Internet sources for secondary information; QGIS being user-friendly encourages users to be more adventureous and explore the many plugins available to their advantage and make their task easier. GIS a complex tool becomes a friend rather than a hinderance. Author ¶ Abbas Abdul Wahab This article was contributed in January 2012 by Abbas Abdul Wahab.

It has 28,000 students studying both on and off campus. The access of off-campus students to modern technologies such as Internet services varies widely. They also use different types of computers (e.g. Notebook, Desktop etc.) with different operating systems (e.g. Windows, MacOS, and Linux).\nProviding education in both an On-campus and Off-campus mode has many technological challenges. Teaching a GIS course requires overcoming these challenges. On average, 300-350 students enrol in the basic GIS course every year. About 80% of them study in the off-campus mode.\nUSQ Main Campus Map created using QGIS QGIS at the University of Southern Queensland ¶ GIS education is incomplete without hands-on processing skills. However, providing hands-on GIS skills to off-campus students is not easy because of issues of internet access, cost of software licenses and compatibility with different computer Operating Systems.\nThe traditional GIS education program at USQ was originally designed to provide different levels of access to GIS learning resources. On-campus students received simultaneous hands-on GIS instruction while the Off-campus students attended a residential school at USQ\u0026rsquo;s main campus later on to receive hands-on GIS instruction. Providing different levels of instruction to different groups of students enrolled in the same course at the same time wasn\u0026rsquo;t considered fair to the students. Removing this inequity became a priority.\nDifferent open access geospatial software programs were evaluated for our needs. QGIS was found to be the most suitable to overcome almost all of the challenges we faced. The particular advantages included its free availability, user-friendliness, adaptability and platform independency. We adopted it and enriched it with additional learning resources developed at USQ.\nThe traditional \u0026lsquo;cook-book\u0026rsquo; tutorial method of teaching was replaced with contemporary audio-visual demonstration presentations followed by problem-based hands-on learning exercises. The course assessments (assignments) were rewritten to require use of GIS software. Students completed more than 24 QGIS based hands-on exercises and an assignment during the semester.\nOn average, 93% of the students in the course used QGIS software and the instructional resources. Voluntary feedback was received from 51% of the QGIS users. The results (Figure 2) show the majority (82%) of the students rated QGIS software and the hands-on learning resources as, \u0026lsquo;helpful\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;very helpful\u0026rsquo; in learning GIS. Most others rated it as \u0026lsquo;reasonable\u0026rsquo;.\nStudents response graph Feedback comments to the question, \u0026quot;what were the best aspects of this course\u0026quot; included:\nThe detail in the recorded QGIS audio-visuals. Using and learning QGIS software The QGIS software was interesting I liked the course especially using QGIS Good choice to use open source software Videos to help navigate QGIS were fantastic The practical activities and teaching of QGIS Having hands on use of programmes through QGIS QGIS was great to get experience using GIS software The QGIS training videos helped to learn the basics of a GIS package The lectures helped with the QGIS by showing you exactly how to use the program The use of QGIS helped break apart and understand theory delivered in this course The QGIS exercises are well designed and take students step by step through the process of using a GIS It is clear that student\u0026rsquo;s benefited substantially from the use of QGIS. QGIS provided the same learning opportunity for each student enrolled in the course irrespective of where they were or how they accessed the material\nConclusion ¶ In conclusion, using QGIS software in teaching GIS courses at educational institutions with an online learning environment offers large benefits to both the students and the university. However, there are two important aspects to successfully using QGIS for learning and teaching. Firstly, there is a need to develop customised hands-on learning resources suitable for local environment and secondly, the assessment procedure should require use of the software.\nAuthors ¶ Dr Badri Basnet (basnetb@usq.edu.au) is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ), where he teaches Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other related courses. Badri has extensive teaching experiences in higher education institutions in and outside Australia. He is heavily involved in scholarship of learning and teaching of GIS courses in an online (or distance) education environment. His learning and teaching research focus is in the development and use of open educational resources in GIS education.\nDr Ernest Dunwoody (edunwoody1@gmail.com) specialises in GIS and remote sensing image analysis applications. This includes ecosystem analysis, sustainable development plans for natural areas, soils mapping, and precision agriculture applications. He has found the wide range of embedded functions, Plugins, and processing tools available through QGIS give it unparalleled flexibility in processing. This familiarity allows him to develop instructional QGIS videos based on Australian spatial data sets.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/case-studies/australia_distance_learning/","tags":null,"title":"QGIS for distance learning and teaching GIS at Universities"},{"categories":null,"contents":" QGIS for monitoring tigers (using camera traps in Nameri Tiger Reserve, Assam, India Sonitpur District) ¶ Nameri Tiger Reserve (NTR) is one of the 3 tiger reserves of Assam and it is situated in the northern part of Sonitpur District of Assam along the foothills of Eastern Himalayas. Spread over an area of 344 sq km, NTR boasts rich diversity of flora and fauna. The core area of the reserve which constitutes the \u0026ldquo;Nameri National Park\u0026rdquo; is bound by River Jia-Bhoreli on the west and River Bor-Dikorai in the east. To the north of the Nameri lies the Pakke Tiger Reserve of Arunachal Pradesh.\nWithin this landscape, the principal species of conservation importance are the Royal Bengal Tiger, Asian Elephant, Indian bison, Common leopard, clouded leopard, Wild dog, Sambar deer, barking deer, hog deer, wild boar and several other species. The bird diversity of NTR is also quite impressive and more than 370 bird species have been identified so far. The reserve is managed by the Assam Forest Department, Government of Assam.\nApplication of QGIS for designing camera trap study ¶ Starting with the year 2011, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) of India has made it mandatory for the all the tiger reserves of the country to monitor tigers by using camera traps. Under this new protocol, 25 pairs of cameras will be installed for 100 sq km of tiger reserve and the sampling period is 40-60 days. This new tiger monitoring protocol relies heavily on the GIS.\nPicture of a male tiger that was captured in one of the camera traps During 2012-13, we implemented this new tiger monitoring protocol in NTR by using QGIS. To begin with, we digitized the NTR boundary in QGIS and saved it as polygon. This boundary polygon was exported to GPS for navigation purpose during the field surveys. We conducted an extensive sign survey in NTR for evidences of tiger presence such pugmarks, scratch marks and scats. GPS coordinates of tiger signs as well as suitable locations for camera traps were recorded. After completion of the survey, the data was transferred to QGIS using GPS tools for further processing and for finalizing camera trap locations. A shape file containing the tiger signs and probable camera trap locations was prepared.\nBlock wise distribution of camera trap locations and assigning camera traps to different forest camps by using voronoi polygons \u0026amp; hub distance. Next we prepared 4 sq km grid layer using mmqgis plugin. The shape file containing results of sign survey was overlaid on the 4 sq grid to visualise the distribution of camera traps in NTR. Distance matrix option under vector analysis tools was quite handy for determining the inter camera distance. Camera locations having less than 1.8 km inter distance were removed to comply with the monitoring protocol. Due to lack of sufficient cameras to monitor the entire reserve area in one go, we decided to divide the reserve area into 2 blocks of 100 sq km each. Boundaries of these blocks were digitised and saved as separate shape files for both the blocks. Using RGB composition plugin, a false color composite of the reserve was created and the sign survey shape file overlaid to assess the habitat types used by the tiger. During the study period, the camera traps have to be monitored intensively by the field staff. To ensure smooth functioning of monitoring process, we used Voronoi polygon feature of Geometry tools and hub distance of mmqgis plugin for planning logistic requirements. The geographic coordinates of camera traps are required for estimating the tiger density and occupancy modelling of other species. These coordinate details were easily generated from camera trap shape files by using the \u0026ldquo;Export/ add geometry columns\u0026rdquo; feature of vector Geometry tools.\nSurvey grids with tiger presence Conclusion ¶ For the first time in the history of this small tiger reserve of North East India, it was possible to monitor tigers by using camera traps mainly because of QGIS. Results of this monitoring exercise indicate the presence of 8-15 tigers in this landscape. In addition to the tigers, several elusive species have also been photographically documented. Apart from tiger monitoring, we are also using QGIS for activities such as planning habitat management works, revising patrolling schedules, and designing maps for visitors. The user-friendly interface, rich features, in-depth documentation, on-line support and the free/open source philosophy are the few qualities of QGIS that made us to select it over other proprietary software. We believe that QGIS has great potential for empowering individuals/institutions/ involved in conserving endangered wildlife in the developing world by offering GIS technology at little or no cost.\nAuthor ¶ Rajendra Garawad This article was contributed by Rajendra G.

It was founded in 2002 by regrouping five former research Institutes and Centers that had been active for more than 40 years in their field of expertise. IGAG covers a wide range of scientific topics in the field of Earth sciences, mainly focusing towards the study of:\nEnvironmental geochemistry and remediation of contaminated soils and waters; Mineral deposits and mineral processing, including the treatment of waste waters; Geoengineering and safety of rock excavations; Recent geological evolution; Mitigation of natural hazards; Geoarchaeology and archaeometry. Marine Geology Geomatics, GIS analysis and development. The level 1 seismic microzonation study of the Pietramontecorvino area (Apulia, Southern Italy, located along the Central-Southern Apennine chain) is part of a project, in collaboration with the Basin Authority of Apulia (Puglia AdB) and the Department of Geology and Geophysics (DGG) of the University of Bari, aimed at the seismic microzonation of 63 Municipalities of the area of Foggia. The activity was promoted by the Italian Department of Civil Protection (DPC) and financed by the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE n. 20/2004).\nQGIS geoprocessing tool for first level seismic microzonation studies ¶ The seismic microzonation evaluate the seismic hazard at the local scale proposing to identify areas of territory characterized by homogeneous seismic behavior. The first level of seismic microzoning has the purpose of defining the lithological properties and geometry of geological units that characterize these portions of territory (microzones).\nThe observation of the damage caused by an earthquake often shows variations at local scale caused not only by geological structures but also by different quality and type of building structures, resulting in different seismic hazards.\nThe seismic microzonation evaluates the local seismic hazard, through the identification of areas of territory characterized by homogeneous seismic behavior.\nThe Guidelines and Criteria for Seismic microzoning 2008 (http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/jcms/it/view_pub.wp?contentId=PUB1137) provide standards for seismic microzoning studies on Italian territory; they distinguish three levels of increasing depth (from 1 to 3).\nThe first level seismic microzonation consists in the creation of three thematic maps:\nSurvey map containing the surveys for seismic microzonation studies; Geo-lithological map, obtained from detailed scale geological and geomorphological maps integrating existing lithological, stratigraphic and geotechnical data related to surveys; Level 1 seismic microzonation map (the principal product of level 1 microzonation), identifying the microzones into three categories of local hazards: Stable zones; Stable zones prone to ground amplification; Unstable zones. The scope of this work is to contribute to the creation of a methodology for processing topographical, geological, geophysical and geo-technical data aimed at level 1 seismic microzonation map drafting, through the use of open source tools.\nThe Graphical Modeler tool integrated in the latest version of QGIS (2.8.1 as of writing) has been used for the creation of a simple geoprocessing model. This tool is useful to automate one of the analysis commonly performed for the creation of level 1 seismic microzonation maps, in particular to identify unstable zones as polygon features.\nThe model makes use of different open source software and libraries (GRASS, GDAL, QGIS), demonstrating the usefulness of QGIS as a simplified and unified interface for heterogeneous GFOSS (Geospatial Free and Open Source Software) tools (Fig. 1).\n(Fig. 1) Screenshot from the geoprocessing model. The model takes as input (Fig. 2):\nA shapefile of contour lines containing a field with elevation values; The name of the field containing elevation values; The desired raster resolution in meters for DEM and Slope (default 10); A polygon shapefile from which features intersecting areas with slope greater than 15 degrees will be extracted; The name of the resulting polygon layer. (Fig. 2) Model input form (left) and execution log (right). When launched, the model performs the following operations:\nThe GRASS tool v.to.rast.attribute converts contour elevation lines to raster, taking the contour shapefile, the name of the z field and the raster resolution as input; The GRASS tool r.surf.contour generates the elevation model taking as input the rasterized temporary output from previous step and the raster resolution; The GDAL tool \u0026ldquo;gdaldem\u0026rdquo; generates the slope expressed as degrees from the elevation model; The GRASS tool r.mapcalculator is used to generate a 1 bit raster identifying areas with slope greater than 15 degrees (this value is coded in the microzonation guidelines, and so it is fixed), using the expression: if(A\u0026gt;15,1,null())\nwhere A is the temporary slope raster generated by gdaldem;\nThe GDAL tool \u0026ldquo;gdal_polygonize\u0026rdquo; converts the 1 bit raster to polygons; The QGIS tool \u0026ldquo;Intersection\u0026rdquo; is used to overlay the areas with slope greater than 15 degrees with the chosen intersection layer. The result is a polygon layer with areas prone to instability due to a slope value greater than 15 degrees, automatically extracted from a thematic map such as a landslides polygon layer (Fig. 3) or a lithological map.\n(Fig. 3) The model output (in red) shows highly unstable areas extracted from a landslides layer (orange). Conclusions ¶ This work clearly demonstrates that open source GIS tools like QGIS, GRASS, GDAL/OGR, can successfully be used for spatial analysis and data processing aimed at first level seismic microzonation studies. In this example work, QGIS has been used as a simplified and unified interface for different high quality GFOSS tools; the Graphical Modeler allows to intuitively construct geoprocessing models that can be easily shared as portable and cross-platform tools that doesn't require expensive software licenses. The tool leverages the QGIS modeling capabilities to graphically chain different algorithms, defining input and output parameters and leaving to the software the task of managing intermediate data output. The use of GRASS algorithms does not require defining and using a GRASS database and mapset, greatly simplifying the design of the model. Future developments include the creation of a package of tools and models, based on open source software, that can be used to simplify and speed up spatial analysis tasks necessary for seismic microzonation studies.\nReferences ¶ G.

In the year 2001 the State Parliament decided to migrate from Windows to Linux. The motivations were to be independent from one particular vendor, to encourage free enterprise and reduce license costs. As a result SO!GIS department of the Canton of Solothurn started to deliver the GIS-requirements of more than 3500 employees with a FOSSGIS strategy.\nThe first step we took was the introduction of UMN MapServer and the creation of a SO!MAP client that offers an easy to use WebGIS client for all the 3500 employees. The second step was the migration of all our geospatial data from Shapefiles to the PostGIS spatial database engine. The introduction was very successful, but an easy to use desktop GIS was lacking.\nAfter an evaluation of different Desktop GIS we decided to use QGIS in conjunction with GRASS, replacing ESRI ArcInfo and ArcView3 in the 2006.\nThe decision was driven by the following aspects:\nDue to our use of desktop GIS in a Linux Terminal Server environment, Java wasn't an option. OSGeo Project-Organisation GUI translated in German language Documentation written in German language An Active developer (Marco Hugentobler) near Solothurn in Switzerland. We could contract Marco Hugentobler to implement missing / lacking features like Digitizing and Mapcomposing. Application and Plugin developement with Python Growing user community Very active developer community Independence from a single operating system Where do we use QGIS ¶ In contrast to the interactive maps served by UMN MapServer, the desktop GIS has to offer a flexible view at the geospatial data of Solothurn. QGIS Desktop GIS is in use by more than 50 users for their daily work. But many of them are not GIS experts. They want to visualize and/or capture geospatial data with an intuitive user interface.\nOne of the most important Desktop GIS issues is the question: \u0026quot;How do I get the information from the PostGIS geodata repository I need?\u0026quot;. Since our end users are unfamiliar with data models and the underlying structures of our spatial database, offering the users a raw connection to the PostGIS DB was not an option. We have a metadata database that stores the descriptions of all production data called 'SO!DATA'.\nSO!DATA contains a human readable inventory of the data models and the non-GIS-Expert user is able to use this database to discover the information they need.\n\"SO!GIS Layer\" plugin developed at the Canton of Solothurn To remove the need for end users to interact directly with PostGIS connections and table selection dialogs, a plugin has been developed in python. The plugin is called \u0026quot;SO!GIS Layer\u0026quot; (see Figure 1). The plugin connects to the SO!GIS PostGIS repository, gets the information of all published geospatial data layers from SO!DATA and offers the user a GUI to find the data layers they need. With this infrastructure in place, our users are happy —— they can prepare for geoprocessing, editing and map composing in an individual way.\n\"SO!GIS Suche\" plugin developed at the Canton of Solothurn Another required QGIS plugin we created is called 'SO!GIS Suche'. This provides the possibility to search for locations like townships, addresses or cadastral parcels (see Figure 2). As a result the user is able to navigate very easily to an area of interest.\nAt the moment many other plugins are under development. These will support data manipulation, analysis or mapping for different projects. Our in-development plugins cover topics such as nature reserves, soil conservation, cadastral data verification, crisis management, abandoned sites and so on.\nConclusion ¶ Today we can say that using QGIS was the right decision for us. QGIS offers most of the features requested by our users. The Canton of Solothurn subcontracts the creation of features that QGIS lacks to commercial support providers. With PyQgis and PyQt there are excellent options for easy in-house application development based on QGIS. One huge benefit is the unlimited number of installations. Everyone who needs to use QGIS can use it without any limitations. To push the development of QGIS the Canton of Solothurn has invested approximately $30,000 into QGIS every year since 2007. This is much more efficient and target-oriented than the payment of support into the black box of our former software provider. Apart from using FOSSGIS, the Canton of Solothurn also provides public geodata free of charge via the SO!ONLINE web portal.\nAuthor ¶ Horst Düster This article was contributed in May 2009 by Dr. Horst Düster.

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026rsquo;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\nYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\nEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0026rsquo; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026ldquo;any later version\u0026rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all of the code used other than Qt. If you modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the file, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs ¶ If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \u0026ldquo;copyright\u0026rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\u0026lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\u0026gt; Copyright (C) \u0026lt;year\u0026gt; \u0026lt;name of author\u0026gt; This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than show w' and show c\u0026rsquo;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items\u0026ndash;whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \u0026ldquo;copyright disclaimer\u0026rdquo; for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision\u0026rsquo; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.

A database was established to store all valid localities, including records published in historical literature sources and specimens vouchered from museums. From the database, a series of maps can be produced representing both locality records and \u0026quot;county records\u0026quot; for each species.\nMOHAP hosts a web site at http://atlas.moherp.org/ that describes the project in detail and displays a variety of static maps, all produced by QGIS. An atlas, published as a downloadable PDF, is released periodically as a gratis publication in the spirit of open access to scientific research (Daniel, R.E. and B.S. Edmond. 2012. Atlas of Missouri Amphibians and Reptiles for 2011. \u0026lt;http://atlas.moherp.org/pubs/atlas11.pdf\u0026gt;). Published maps are used by field biologists, land managers, and others to better understand species' distributions in Missouri.\nAs of February 2013, the MOHAP database contained 31,495 entries representing the specimens housed in 34 museum collections and cited in 32 historical literature sources; 5,118 documented county records; 6,884 unique localities; and 12,866 unique species / locality combinations. The state's herpetofauna consists of 113 species.\nGenerate and Export Static Maps ¶ The process of creating maps with QGIS starts with data stored in several PostgreSQL tables, spatially-enabled with PostGIS. Because maps are static and ultimately destined for either the web or a printed atlas, they are generated automatically for each species using a custom QGIS Python plugin (Figures 1,2).\nCustom map generation and export user interface, maps are generated and exported in a batch process. The final species maps have a clean and professional appearance (Figure 3). To better understand species' distributions, a series of base maps are also created and labelled (Figure 4). Because of the way styles are managed within each data layer, the base map layers can also be incorporated into a set of species maps with little extra effort.\nMaps are displayed as static images. Labelled Level III Ecoregion map for Missouri and surrounding states. Conclusions ¶ At the beginning of the MOHAP project, several commercial and proprietary tools were used to store and process data and produce maps for publication. Starting in 2007, we set about to move all aspects of the project to open source software. QGIS, along with PHP, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Python, and ReportLab, forms the open source linchpin to MOHAP, effectively allowing the project and all data to exist free of proprietary software entanglements.\nQGIS contains native support for PostGIS and a Python plugin architecture, which were essential in creating the automated map generation and export. The extensive API documentation was used along with the plugin developer cookbook to create exactly what we needed for the automation. The community support is also very good and includes a huge array of shared plugins built and ready to use.\nAlthough we use QGIS in a small and specific way, its capabilities and extensibility using Python is more than sufficient to tackle larger and more complex projects.\nAuthor ¶ Brian Edmond This article was contributed by Brian Edmond in February 2013.

It was formed with the aim of providing access to university through its eLearning platform to young people, professionals, entrepreneurs, executives and business and cultural actors in order to contribute to the labor market. The headquarters, also known as Milan International Campus, or Campus of Novedrate, is located in the ex IBM training center of Novedrate (Como, Italy), on a campus in the quiet green Brianza.\nThe University has 5 Virtual faculties: Engineering, Economics, Psychology, Arts, Law. THE HISTORICAL MAPS AND THE QGIS PROJECT The City Wall characterizes the city of Cesena. Its scorpion shape divides the historic center from the newly zone.\nThe historical cartographic documents describe its evolution and its destructions. The QGIS program allow me to compare different historical maps, because it permit to transfer all the maps in the same Reference System, with the georeferencing plugin. As a reference the open layer Google Satellite and the open layer Open Street Map have been used to refer all the historical maps to the Reference System EPSG: 3857 (Web Mercator or Pseudo Mercator).\nQGIS has been a fundamental tool to elaborate, analyze, compare these georeferenced maps through the vectorial layers or shapefiles, in which I memorized all the elements ofthe maps, such as roads, buildings, parks and gardens, City Wall, the ancient fortified towers and the ancient City Gates. I used puntual, linear and polygonal layers. I compared these layers through the analysis, research, geoprocessing, geometry and data management tools (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Concept Map of the QGIS project Using this tools, I got informations about:\nThe precision of the Leonardo Da Vinci's topographic survey, realized in 1502, such as how many points of this survey are correct (Fig. 2); The Cesena Wall's Development from the Roman Age to the 15th Century; The Cesena Wall's Demolitions from the 19th Century to the Early 20th Century; The morphological changes of the City Wall, such as the demolitions of its ancient fortified towers and its ancient City Gates; The Cesena's Urban Progress from the 16th Century to the Present; Fig. 2: Openlayer Google Satellite overlapped by the informations recorded in different layers: the present City Wall in black, the Leonardo Da Vinci's topographic survey of the City Wall in orange, the Leonardo Da Vinci's points of survey in yellow and the present ancient City Gates in red. There are lots of QGIS tools, and I used some of these to create:\nLinks that connected each section of the linear layer of the present City Wall to photos, which represent the actual state of conservation; A map of Cesena in the 19th Century through the print composer; A 3D Model of Cesena with qgis2threejs plugin (Fig. 3); Fig. 3: The 3D model of the present City Wall and Cesena's buildings inside and outside the Wall. The ancient fortified towers and the ancient City Gates are indicated. Conclusion ¶ The historical maps are important documents even if its precision cannot be compared to the precision of the actual cartographic document, and they are very communicative representations also for those who are not specialists on geographic representations. QGIS was the only means that allowed me to use the numerical content of the historical maps according to an effective and meaningful representation.\nBibliographic Index ¶ The historical maps have been extracted by:\n\u0026quot;Costruzione, alterazione e recupero del centro storico di Cesena\u0026quot;, Ballardini, Cantori, Pezzi, Righetti, Tossani, Bruno Ghigi Editore, 1977 \u0026quot;La cinta muraria di Cesena\u0026quot;, Pino Montalti, Edizioni Panini, 1986 The historical informations have been extracted by:\n\u0026quot;La cartografia in Italia: nuovi metodi e nuovi strumenti dal Settecento ad Oggi\u0026quot;, Andrea Cantile, IGM Firenze, 2007 \u0026quot;Lineamenti di storia della cartografia italiana, volume secondo, dal Seicento al Novecento\u0026quot; Andrea Cantile, Geoweb, 2013 \u0026quot;I rilievi cartografici di Leonardo per Cesena ed Urbino contenuti nel manoscritto 'L' dell'Istituto di Francia\u0026quot;, Nando De Toni, G.

Headquarter is located at Hyderabad city of India and it has three sub centres at Guwahati, Jaipur and Patna city. Jaipur city is capital of Rajasthan State (North Western side of country). The NIRD Jaipur Centre is actively involved in short (mostly 5 days including one-day handheld GPS survey and local visit) residential GIS trainings for middle level government officials of North Indian States. Reputed NGOs and Scholars are also trained if interested. Trainings are fully sponsored by NIRD and participants are to bear only their travel expenses. The author is working in NIRD Jaipur centre as an Assistant Professor and coordinating GIS and Watershed related trainings at the centre. Initially at the time of his posting at Headquarter of NIRD at Hyderabad, he was involved in GIS trainings with commercial software like ArcGIS and ERDAS. After getting opportunity of a two days training on QuantumGIS at IIT Madras in 2009, it was felt that the Open Source GIS can fulfil the need of Rural Development sector of India. The version learnt in training was QGIS 1.0.2. The training feedback was provided to seniors and it was recommended to introduce QGIS in further trainings but apprehensions were there in accepting the software in mainstream of trainings. Software was then pursued for the personal use for one year and its new versions were checked for the enhanced functionalities. During this whenever author was course coordinator in training, he used QGIS in trainings for introduction and feedbacks.\nQGIS is used for all GIS training courses ¶ QGIS training course at NIRD Jaipur Centre Since creation of NIRD Jaipur centre, only QuantumGIS is being used for all GIS trainings at the centre. Further it is being messaged and advised in all trainings that no commercial GIS software should be purchased at District (administrative unit in India after Nation and State) and below, if real requirement is not felt and this saving may be used for purchase of hardware like GPSs, computers etc.\nThere is a question why QGIS only when other software like uDig, MapWindow, gvSIG, GRASS are also there. The answer lies in the facts that QGIS is an OSGeo incubated project, less complex, its development is very fast and associated with huge community of users and developers and lastly authors expertise. With its latest version of 1.8, software is capable of satisfying the all needs of grass root rural development executors in India with satisfying the present queries and wishes for future.\nThe applications of software during training are generally concentrated on Watershed and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) as these two are land based flagships of Government of India. Local Open Source Raster and Vector data are used in exercises. Participants are encouraged to come with their own or departmental data if available to work. Training is provided in lab equipped with 15 computers of i5, 8GB RAM and Windows7 OS. Per training number of trainees remains between 20-30.\nConducted QGIS training courses and participants General topics covered are basic introduction to the GIS and QGIS software , major tool bars, plug-in structure, geo-referencing, creation/editing of vector data, clip (Raster/Vector), merge, terrain analysis, contours, .csv to .shp layer, .shp to .kml and vice versa, handling GPS data, Interpolation, table editing/query, field calculator, print composer etc. and some basic analysis on vector data. Apart from introduction to various help links available, a LinkedIn group for participants has been created for post training support.\nNumber of QGIS-based trainings conducted by author with participants\u0026rsquo; details is shown in the table:\nSuccess ¶ Every month training is conducted with 20-30 participants so this number is increasing every month. Training feedbacks are remaining very positive and encouraging. Certificates are provided to the participants after completion of training. Presently handouts are being supplied to the participants in hard copy and tutorial, software and practice data in soft copies but plan is there to create DVDs containing screen-recorded lectures/demo of various topics in Hindi and English language.

Voting Members vote on any motion raised at the Annual General Meeting. Voting Members also nominate and elect the PSC membership.\nTypes of voting members ¶ QGIS User group voting members QGIS Community voting members One OSGEO representative voting member Honorary voting members Composition, appointment and role of voting members ¶ The voting members shall be appointed according to the following scheme:\nQGIS User Group Voting Members: One voting member per QGIS country level user group. Each user group will nominate who their voting member shall be. QGIS Community Voting Members: For each user group voting member, there will be one voting community member elected. OSGeo Voting Member: One voting member representing the OSGeo foundation put forward by the OSGeo board. Election and eligibility of QGIS User Group voting members ¶ Only country-level user groups may put forward a nominated voting member. In order to be recognised, a user group must be approved by the PSC. The user group should democratically nominate one person from within their ranks to act as their representative within the QGIS.ORG voting membership.\nElection and eligibility of QGIS Community voting members ¶ QGIS community members will be nominated and voted for by the established QGIS committers. Any active QGIS community member will be eligible for nomination as a QGIS.ORG voting member. Voting Memberships shall be awarded on a ‘first past the post’ basis, with the nominee receiving the greatest number of votes being awarded voting membership first and so on in descending order of number of votes received until all voting memberships have been allocated. Honorable members ¶ Honorable members are individual persons who receive special acknowledgment for extraordinary achievements in the QGIS project. Applications for the nomination of an honorable member should be directed to the PSC. The general meeting shall vote about the acceptance of a new honorable member. Honorable members shall have voting rights.\nVoting member terms ¶ Voting memberships will be valid until:\nThe voting member resigns There is a motion raised from within the voting membership, and passed vote by the voting membership to remove the member A voting member gets elected to the PSC in which case voting membership of the new PSC member will be relinquished and a new voting member will be elected in the new PSC member’s place. Outgoing PSC members that were previously voting members will need to be re-elected into the voting membership should they wish to return to their former role. Sustaining Members ¶ Sustaining members are members who support QGIS.ORG financially with an annual membership fee. This membership fee is used to cover expenses of QGIS.ORG infrastructure, events and other initiatives to improve the project. Membership fees help to ensure that the QGIS community and the software we produce can be maintained and improved in a sustainable way. Sustaining members have no voting rights (unless they are simultaneously voting members in which case their voting rights are unaffected).\nThe following categories are offered for sustaining members, based on their size and assigned through self declaration:\nSmall (e.g. for smaller cities or companies up to 10 employees) Medium (e.g. for universities, medium size cities or companies up to 50 employees) Large (e.g. for larger cities, provinces or companies up to 100 employees) Flagship (e.g. for companies larger than 100 employees, federal governmental organizations) Membership fees are approved or changed by the general assembly. They are defined as minimum fees per category, but may be increased if the sustaining member chooses to do so.\nBecause QGIS.ORG is a world-wide project and different companies, NGOs or governmental organizations have different financial prospects, we do not enforce any membership levels - the organizations pick their own membership level based on self-assessment.\nAcceptance of sustaining members shall be subject to the discretion and approval of The Board, who reserve the right to accept or reject applications for sustaining membership and ongoing support memberships as deemed appropriate.\nThe fees for membership levels and guidelines for management of sustaining members are provided in the governance section of the QGIS.ORG website.\nThe board ¶ The board is the legal representation of the QGIS.ORG project with authority to sign legal documents on behalf of the QGIS.ORG project.\nThe official domicile of the association shall be determined by the board. The group is legally represented by the chair’s signature and a signature of an additional member of the board.\nThe treasurer has sole authority to carry out financial transactions provided they are within the bounds of the annual budget authorized by the general meeting.\nElection of board members ¶ Board members shall also be members of the PSC and shall be nominated and elected by the general meeting. In an election of board members, the nominee receiving the greatest number of votes for each position (chair, vice chair, treasurer) shall be appointed. A tied election shall trigger a re-vote until one nominee has the majority.\nVotes of non-elected Chair candidates shall be used as replacement of the voter’s vice-chair vote.\nOn expiration of a board member’s term, nominees from within the QGIS community shall be put forward by the QGIS Voting Members. The outgoing board member shall automatically receive a nomination unless he/she no longer wishes to serve on the board.\nTerms of members of the board ¶ Board members will serve for a two year term.\nComposition of the board ¶ The board shall include at minimum these roles:\nChair Vice-chair Treasurer Board and PSC Member remuneration ¶ Board and PSC members will receive no remuneration for their services other than reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred when carrying out activities on behalf of the board.\nReplacement of Board Members ¶ In the event of a board member resigning from the board, the PSC shall put forward from within their ranks a replacement for the board who shall serve in that position until the next AGM is called.\nThe Project Steering Committee (PSC) ¶ Election of PSC members ¶ On expiration of a PSC member’s term, nominees from within the QGIS Community shall be put forward by any QGIS Community Member. The outgoing PSC member shall automatically receive a nomination unless he/she no longer wishes to serve on the PSC. If an incoming PSC member is a Voting Member, they will relinquish their voting membership in the general meeting on joining the PSC.\nPrior to the election, the outgoing PSC determines the total number of seats of the incoming committee. QGIS Voting Members shall be allowed a number of votes equal to the number of PSC memberships up for election and shall be asked to rank their votes in order of preference. After removing elected Board members from the vote results, PSC memberships shall be awarded on the total vote count, with the nominee receiving the greatest count being awarded PSC membership first and so on in descending order of number of votes received until all PSC memberships have been allocated. A list of currently serving PSC members shall be maintained at: https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/\nTerms of members of the PSC ¶ PSC members will serve for a two year term.\nHonorary PSC members ¶ Gary Sherman, as founder of the QGIS project, shall be accorded lifetime honorary membership on the QGIS PSC from its inception. By common vote, QGIS.ORG may award any individual a lifetime honorary seat on the PSC.\nAdministration of QGIS.ORG ¶ The annual general meeting (AGM) will be held via a virtual forum.

The package is developed by the Norwegian Polar Institute, as a tool for the research community, for classrooms and for operational use in Antarctica — freely available for non-commercial purposes.\nAbout the project ¶ Screenshot from Quantarctica, showing one of the subglacial lakes datasets. Quantarctica (QGIS + Antarctica) was first developed for in-house use at the Norwegian Polar Institute, as a tool for our glaciologists. There was a need for a low or no cost complete GIS with essential datasets — ready-to-use, easy-to-use, functionality rich and with offline capabilities. QGIS seemed to be a perfect choice of GIS for the collected datasets.\nQuantarctica has been used to examine geographical data from continental to local scales, for viewing scientific project data on top of base maps or with other scientific datasets, and to prepare maps for publications and proposals. Quantarctica has so far proven to be a great tool, and a very good alternative and supplement to other software used by the researchers. It has provided new opportunities for our researchers in their daily work.\nQuantarctica is also useful when navigating on the Antarctic ice shelves thanks to the GPS tracking capabilities within QGIS. Since Quantarctica first came in use by our glaciologists three years ago, there has been many requests in the research community outside the institute to share this product, and we started to develop a public and improved version to replace the in-house version. Following Antarctic field testing, and adding new relevant datasets, Quantarctica version 1.0 was finally completed and made available for download in July 2013.\nQuantarctica is to be all about community effort. With contributions we aim to expand with data from other disciplines, such as oceanography, atmospheric sciences, geology and biology, and hope and believe that this tool can be useful for the Antarctic community — as a complete Antarctic GIS package.\nLinks ¶ Quantarctica website: https://www.npolar.no/quantarctica/ Norwegian Polar Institute: https://www.npolar.no/en/ Authors ¶ Anders Skoglund and Kenichi Matsuoka This article was contributed in August 2013 by Anders Skoglund (left), GIS specialist, and Kenichi Matsuoka (right), glaciologist, both at the Norwegian Polar Institute.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/case-studies/antarctica/","tags":null,"title":"Quantarctica: An Antarctic GIS package"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Reimbursements for Developer Meetings ¶ The QGIS project holds twice-yearly developer meetings, typically somewhere in Europe. The purpose of the meetings is to provide face-to-face time for developers. It is a forum for presenting new ideas, planning, putting heads together to solve problems and so on.\nWe use funding from our Sustaining Membership Program Overview to facilitate the event, with co-funding from the host who usually supplies the venue and the infrastructure for hosting the meeting. Individual developers also co-fund the event by donating their time and in many cases financially supporting their visit to the meeting directly.\nNeed a refund for QGIS HF expenses? ¶ If you are a contributor to the project (to either code, documentation, translation, or infrastructure), you think your participation to the HF will be useful for the project, and you do not have funds to cover for travelling and lodging, you can apply for refund, at least 40 days in advance\nWhen applying, please let us know (i) an estimate of the total amount required, and (ii) how your participation will contribute to QGIS\nLater applications (\u0026lt;40 days) will be taken into account, based on the budget available and the priorities of the PSC\nPlease note that our funds are limited, so we’ll generally not be able to refund all participants\nCore devs (anyone with direct commit rights to the repository) and psc members will have priority on the allocation of funds\nAt least 30 days in advance, PSC will communicate a decision to all those who applied\nThe refund will be sent to your bank account after the HF, on the basis of the bills actually paid and sent to our Treasurer.\nIn case of doubt ¶ The project steering committee shall provide arbitration for any query, complaint or appeal relating to funding requests by individual developers. In the event that the PSC is called apon to arbitrate, a resolution shall be proposed and the PSC members shall vote using the -1 / 0 / +1 system to indicate dissent, indifference and assent respectively. In the event of a tie-break, the PSC Chairman shall make the final decision.

See the download pages for updates on availability. Releases and development of QGIS follow a timebased schedule (roadmap).\nEven version numbers (2.18, 3.2 etc) are release versions.\nOdd version numbers (2.99, 3.1 etc) are development versions.\nA new release will happen every four months. In the first three months, new development is taking place. In the last month before a release, a feature freeze is invoked and the final month is used for testing, bugfixing, translation and release preparations. When the release happens, a branch with an even release number is created and the master branch advances to the next odd version. After the release a call for packaging is issued.\nEvery third release (starting with 2.8) is a long-term-release (LTR) that is maintained until the next long-term-release occurs.\nDevelopment phase ¶ In the development phase, developers work on adding new features for the next release. Early adopters can use the nightly builds we have for all major platforms to see the development progress, do preliminary testing and provide bug reports and their thoughts to help with development.\nFeature freeze ¶ In the feature freeze phase, new features are not allowed in anymore and the focus of everyone moves from enhancing QGIS to stabilizing it. This also turns the nightly builds effectively into prereleases.\nUsers should start extensive testing of these prereleases in their environment to verify that there are no issues, they wouldn’t want to see in the upcoming release. All such issues should be reported (see Bugs, Features and Issues). Everything that goes unnoticed, will also end up in the next release. Only in case of serious problems backports to a latest release will occur. Therefore testing of the prereleases and reporting issues is very important.\nIn the feature freeze, developers monitor the bugtracker and start working on fixing the reported issues and update the visual changelog with the features they added.\nWith the start of the feature freeze, the translation files will be updated so that translators can start their work. Note that this might be an incremental process as although the features are frozen, bug fixes might still introduce translation string changes.\nTwo weeks before the release, a hard freeze is initiated after which only fixes to severe problems and regressions introduced after the feature freeze are allowed in.\nThe release manager announces this on feature freeze.\nRelease ¶ On major and minor release dates, the release branch is created and the release is tagged and tar balls are prepared. Point releases are just tagged and tar balls are created.\nThe packagers are notified that packaging can begin.\nOnce some packages are available the release can be announced and the website is updated accordingly.\nRelease schedule ¶ The schedule is aligned to produce roughly the same dates for each year given our four monthly releases with LTRs entering the LTR repo in late february.\nBeginning after 2.12 the development phase is always 12 weeks and the freeze phase is at least 5 weeks. Remainders are used to extend the freeze phase of LTR releases.\nPoint releases will happen every month on the latest release branch branch, if there are backports. Beginning with the 3.28 release point releases are only done with new latest releases.\nIn the first four months after its release, a new LTR is also the current LR. In this phase, the new LTR doesn’t replace the previous LTR in the LTR repositories. This happens as soon as a new LR is released.\nThis schedule is also available as “iCalendar”.\nSchedule ¶ Event Latest Long-Term Repo Freeze Date Week # Weeks LTR/PR 3.28.0 3.22.12 2022-10-21 43 4 PR 3.28.1 3.22.13 2022-11-18 47 4 PR 3.28.2 3.22.14 2022-12-16 51 6 PR/FF 3.28.3 3.22.15 3.29 2023-01-27 5 5 EPR 3.22.16 2023-02-03 6 LR/PR 3.30.0 3.28.4 2023-03-03 10 4 PR 3.30.1 3.28.5 2023-03-31 14 4 PR 3.30.2 3.28.6 2023-04-28 18 4 PR/FF 3.30.3 3.28.7 3.31 2023-05-26 22 4 LR/PR 3.32.0 3.28.8 2023-06-23 26 4 PR 3.32.1 3.28.9 2023-07-21 30 4 PR 3.32.2 3.28.10 2023-08-18 34 4 PR/FF 3.32.3 3.28.11 3.33 2023-09-15 38 6 LTR/PR 3.34.0 3.28.12 2023-10-27 44 4 PR 3.34.1 3.28.13 2023-11-24 48 4 PR 3.34.2 3.28.14 2023-12-22 52 4 PR/FF 3.34.3 3.28.15 3.35 2024-01-19 3 5 LR/PR 3.36.0 3.34.4 2024-02-23 8 4 PR 3.36.1 3.34.5 2024-03-22 12 4 PR 3.36.2 3.34.6 2024-04-19 16 4 PR/FF 3.36.3 3.34.7 3.37 2024-05-17 20 5 LR/PR 3.38.0 3.34.8 2024-06-21 25 4 PR 3.38.1 3.34.9 2024-07-19 29 4 PR 3.38.2 3.34.10 2024-08-16 33 4 PR/FF 3.38.3 3.34.11 3.39 2024-09-13 37 6 LTR/PR 3.40.0 3.34.12 2024-10-25 43 4 PR 3.40.1 3.34.13 2024-11-22 47 4 PR 3.40.2 3.34.14 2024-12-20 51 4 PR/FF 3.40.3 3.34.15 3.41 2025-01-17 3 5 LR/PR 3.42.0 3.40.4 2025-02-21 8 4 PR 3.42.1 3.40.5 2025-03-21 12 4 PR 3.42.2 3.40.6 2025-04-18 16 4 PR/FF 3.42.3 3.40.7 3.43 2025-05-16 20 5 LR/PR 3.44.0 3.40.8 2025-06-20 25 4 PR 3.44.1 3.40.9 2025-07-18 29 4 PR 3.44.2 3.40.10 2025-08-15 33 4 PR/FF 3.44.3 3.40.11 3.45 2025-09-12 37 6 LTR/PR 3.46.0 3.40.12 2025-10-24 43 4 PR 3.46.1 3.40.13 2025-11-21 47 4 PR 3.46.2 3.40.14 2025-12-19 51 4 PR/FF 3.46.3 3.40.15 2026-01-16 3 5 Event legend ¶ LTR Long term release, begin of new development phase LR Regular release, begin of new development phase FF Feature freeze, end of development phase PR Point release of latest release and LTR branch EPR Extra Point release current currently supported releases: 3.34.9 and 3.38.1 next next releases Location of prereleases / nightly builds ¶ Platform Location Windows OSGeo4W Linux Debian/Ubuntu MacOS Mac OS ","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/resources/roadmap/","tags":null,"title":"Road Map"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Security information ¶ The QGIS community takes security seriously. We are aware that QGIS is deployed in sensitive environments. This page outlines how the QGIS project responds to vulnerabilities and security matters.\nWhat is a vulnerability in QGIS? ¶ QGIS is a project that can be used in many contexts and has a rich set of features. To provide this functionality, it relies on many components, relying on a large base of external dependencies (e.g. GDAL, PROJ, Python libraries, Qt, etc.). Security issues in QGIS can arise in various scenarios, including, but not limited to, vulnerabilities in its dependencies, issues within QGIS code itself, or through the misuse of its Python bindings. Here are the main categories:\nVulnerabilies of underlying libraries ¶ If you run a code scanner, most of the vulnerabilities listed are not related to QGIS, but to its dependencies. The specific version of the dependencies shipped with QGIS depends on the OS and packaging system being used.\nOn Windows, QGIS.org uses the OSGEO4W project to distribute a complete environment. The OSGEO4W build is fully maintained by the QGIS project.\nOSGEO4W provides update scripts, allowing you to upgrade only the necessary libraries without the need to redownload the entire package. For more information on setting up these scripts for your deployment, refer to the OSGEO4W documentation.\nOn Ubuntu / Debian, we provide QGIS binaries and work closely with packagers of OSGEO libraries (GDAL / PROJ / GRASS). For Python and Qt libraries, which rely on your operating system, please ensure they are updated regularly using your system\u0026rsquo;s update manager. For Ubuntu/Debian, this typically involves using commands like sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade.\nOther Linux distribution packages are maintained by the community, such as Conda, FlatPak, etc. Any issue should be raised to the downstream maintainers.\nFalse positives ¶ Receiving red flags from code scanner alerts can be alarming, but many of the current alerts are false positives, so keep calm and don\u0026rsquo;t panic.\nFor example, a common false positive might involve the PostgreSQL client library (libpq) being flagged for server-side vulnerabilities, which do not apply to QGIS\u0026rsquo;s use case.\nWhen discovering a potential vulnerability, read the CVE report, go to the upstream project CVE description and please verify this really concerns QGIS.\nPlease also communicate these findings to your code scanner vendor for catalog updates, to reduce the number of false positives being emitted in the future.\nThere is not a lot QGIS contributors can do to resolve reports where the classification of dependencies is not accurate in the CVE database.\nVulnerabilities of QGIS itself ¶ Those are extremely rare but can occur (as they can in any software).\nQGIS server and QGIS Desktop have been written to limit the possibility of SQL injections and various known security vectors, and has been used by big corporations and governments for many years.\nWhat to do if you think you have found a security issue ¶ If you believe you have found a security issue, such as vulnerabilities in QGIS or its dependencies, please refer to the security page for detailed information on how to report it responsibly. Before this, please do the following:\nCheck you are using the latest version of QGIS, and have a glance at the nightly version for potential ongoing changes (fixes or regressions). Check if your issue concerns QGIS desktop or QGIS server. Please check our bug tracker to see if we already have an existing and potential fix. Assuming you still need to raise the issue, raise a private disclosure to the security teams via our GitHub security page. Please avoid publicly disclosing the vulnerability until it has been resolved to prevent potential exploitation. Running python QGIS ¶ Python bindings allow you to extend QGIS by writing plugins, geoprocessing models, actions, project macros, or even rewrite a full application.\nIn a desktop environment, any scripting language typically has full access to the user\u0026rsquo;s resources and can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user. If you execute external code it can potentially do a lot of harm.\nThe QGIS plugins repository is open for anyone to use to publish their work. We review submissions manually. We do not undertake advanced QA assessments of plugin code. Plugins should not bundle compiled code, so you know what you get in each plugin and are free to audit the code.\nIf your are working in a sensitive environment, we advise you to :\nCarefully audit each plugin in a sandboxed environment before you allow your users to use it. Deploy your own plugin repository so that you can control which plugins are available to your users. Make use of the advanced customization capabilities of QGIS to constrain settings around connections, authentication etc. Don\u0026rsquo;t only focus on code breaches, but also on user behavior regarding credentials and the risk of leaks in project files if users insist on using basic authentication (which will result in credentials being stored in plain text in project files). Do we generate Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)? ¶ Currently, QGIS project is not a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), so we don\u0026rsquo;t emit CVE identifiers.\nSecurity Process and workflow ¶ Disclosures are discussed in a private dedicated repository.\nFixes are shipped as soon as possible in point releases - depending on the criticality of the issue.\nIf you want to secure your QGIS enterprise deployment, please ensure you are able to quickly deploy fixes to the machines you manage.\nOSGEO4W provides update scripts that can run unattended. These scripts also allow you to upgrade only the necessary libraries without the need to re-download the entire package. For more information on setting up these scripts for your deployment, refer to the OSGEO4W documentation.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/resources/support/security/","tags":null,"title":"Security"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Support ¶ Before you start ¶ Before you head off to join up with your chose support group, we would like to mention a few guidelines for participating in our community:\nStay on topic ¶ This forum is for sharing ideas, tools, tutorials, case studies, and questions related only to the use of QGIS (and related tools) in various fields.

We are trying to understand the changing patterns of human settlement and land use over a period of 2,000 years from the Iron Age, Gallo-Roman, Medieval periods into the present. Our project has included a wide variety of disciplinary researchers, and part of our project includes how to conduct such long-duration interdisciplinary research activities. GIS, GPS and remote sensing have been integral to our work, and our GIS database was first created in 1986, one of the first such archaeological applications. We have done archaeological, historical, geological, ecological, and ethnographic research in the area surrounding the commune of Uxeau, in Southern Burgundy, which is a rich and resilient landscape that has maintained productivity and stability for an extended period.\nOur Project and how QGIS is used ¶ Our research, organized by the theoretical framework of Historical Ecology, centers on the interaction of people, their societies, natural and built environments, and how these have changed over time. Using a collection of historical maps of the area dating back to 1659, we have scanned, digitized and extracted features for a total of 21 maps into our extensive project GIS database. Features in our database include land cover (forest, vineyards, pasture and agriculturecropland), ponds and streams, mills, roads and buildings from these different dates, where possible. We also have cadastral parcel data from 1834, 1964 and 2012, giving us detailed data on changing patterns of detailed land use for the commune of Uxeau (see location in Figure 1). Our project is interdisciplinary, and we have conduced extensive field surveys, oral history and ethnographic interviews, documentary research in various librariesarchives, and geological and ecological analysis (see Figure 3).\nAn important feature of this landscape is water, and that is one of the fociuses of our current research. The area is interlaced with streams that have been dammed to form ponds, many dating to at least the middle ages. The creation and maintenance of these ponds with their earthen dams required a great deal of labor and expense. Our research has shown that these man-made ponds were used to water livestock, raise fish for domestic consumption and sale, launder clothing, soak hemp for processing, and for recreation. One of the most important functions of ponds in the past was to run mills, primarily for grinding grain, but also for pressing oil and cutting lumber. Many of these mills have disappeared and many of the surviving mill buildings are endangered due to neglect or redevelopment. Our recent field survey of ponds and mill sites identified from the historical maps was designed to document the remaining pond and mill sites, verify our historical data, test new GIS and GPS technologies, and better understand the conditions and changing function of these features in the present economy.\nOur field surveys included assessing, videoing and photographing these sites, verifying their location by taking GPS points and, through the use of our Garmin GPS, to align historical maps with the present landscape (see Figure 2). We also conducted interviews with some of the present owners of pond and mill sites. Our work has documented 52 ponds and 27 mills in the region.\nThe data and types of analyses we are currently using to study this complex landscape include a series of maps ranging in date from 1759 to 2012, which are integrated within our larger GIS database, historical records such as cadastral tax records, agricultural reports, and population data from censuses and parish/civil registers, environmental data from ponds (pollen, sediment geochemistry, grain size, stable isotopes), and oral history/ethnographic interviews with local rural inhabitants.\nA view of our project QGIS database. At right is the eVis GPS ground photo and data of a recently drained pond dating back at least to 1834. In the GIS image at center top you can see the location of the pond as a yellow dot. Red dots show other eVis ground photos of mills and other historical or archaeological sites. Conclusion ¶ Our project started using GRASS in 1986, and has continued to use this, as well as commercial ArcGIS and a variety of other tools such as Photoshop, Garmin\u0026rsquo;s BaseCamp, eVis and others. With many collaborators at various institutions in the US and Europe, and graduate students coming and going, using free and open source tools makes a lot of sense. We have found that the combination of QGIS and GRASS provides capable data analysis and visualization, ease of use, interoperability, and portability for our project. Archaeologists have had a strong presence in the GRASS and open source GIS communities for many years, and have contributed much to this important effort, developing and sharing many capabilities. I have taught several 4-day QGIS/GRASS/R short courses in France over the years, sharing these tools with many archaeologists from throughout France.\nOur research will continue to explore the long-term history of the inhabitants\u0026rsquo; relationship with this landscape and we will expand our work beyond our current focus on mills and ponds to include changing patterns of forests, pastures and meadows, croplands and former vineyards in the area.\nFrom top left going clockwise: Some of the local Charolais cattle, doing ethnographic interviews with local farmers, a GIS map showing forest change from 1759 to 1983, and a book of Uxeau 1791 cadastral tax records.

The skills gathered since its foundation concern various following investigation sectors, e.g. the study of geological and hydrogeological features of the Alpine-Po river system (Northern Italy) or the monitoring, prediction and prevention of natural disasters. These tasks are carried out by the employment of a multidisciplinary approach including hearth sciences, engineering and geomatic.\nIn order to carry out exhaustive researches and studies, in addition to field survey, modelling and historical records analysis, aerial photograms are employed. Their use varies, from \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; visual analyses to complex processing as stereoplotting or image segmentation.\nThe institute, for the explained purposes, keeps in its archive about 170000, recent and historical, photograms —— the oldest one dating back to 1920s (Figure 1) —— covering, in different years, the Po basin or part of it. Some photograms cover other basins in northern Italy. In addition the archives keeps flight plans of the described photograms (Figure 1).\n1929 photogram (left) and 1954 flight plan (right). Archive management ¶ In order to cope with such amount of data a GIS approach was adopted. First each flight plan, showing photograms\u0026rsquo; footprints, was scanned, georeferenced and digitized in shapefile format. Then photograms were scanned, at 600 DpI, and files were named according to a code including map sheet, year of acquisition, strip number, photogram\u0026rsquo;s serial number and code of property (IRPI\u0026rsquo;s or external).\nEach footprint in digitized flight plan was provided, in its attributes, with the previous codes in order to link shapefile to scanned photograms, by the use of eVis plugin (Horning et al, 2009), and to allow a user friendly interface to search and refer to (Figure 2). Data concerning photogram code were stored in attribute table fields than, by field calculator, a \u0026ldquo;Link\u0026rdquo; field was created storing photograms\u0026rsquo; file paths.\nPhotogram display (eVis Plugin) Moreover, due to the amount of searchable data a geographical search interface was developed. Thanks to the graphical modeler (in Processing, formerly SEXTANTE, plugin) capabilities, the developed tool, by different selection masks and input boxes, allows the user to select among three layers (administrative boundaries, map sheets and rivers), find a feature by querying its table and employ it to spatially query a digitized flight plan with the purpose of selecting photograms\u0026rsquo; footprints intersecting the selected feature (Figure 3). With this procedure, is then possible to point out selected photogram and simply display them with the previously described tool or extract, by their filenames and path, photograms\u0026rsquo; files for further processing.\nGraphic modeler scheme used in the selection tool (in background: purple polygons-map sheets; labeled orange polygons-photogram footprints; brown polygons-municipalities administrative borders) The photogram collection is of great interest both in research (e.g. Godone et al, 2014) and professional environments (Figure 4). Now thanks to the described procedures and tools the collection is fully accessible and since 2009 the photograms were employed in several projects both internal and external to the Institute. QGIS features and plugins allowed developing tools and procedures to optimize photogram archive both in the implementation of its management and in its exploitation.\nPie chart showing different area of interest employing photograms in year 2013 References ¶ Godone D., Garbarino M., Sibona E., Garnero G., Godone F.

Encouraged by the decision of the Kanton of Solothurn to use QGIS as a Desktop GIS replacement for ArcView, Uster decided to also give it a try. The city joined the effort for the further development of the QGIS application, by suggesting and testing new features and by financially supporting the development. In return Uster receives a rapidly evolving and platform independent Desktop GIS and WebGIS solution backed by a worldwide user and development community.\nPostgis/PostgreSQL is used as a central geodata warehouse. Other databases and data sources are replicated into PostgreSQL at a regular interval, using tools such as OGR and FME. In the beginning QGIS was mainly used as a viewer. The first QGIS user was a farmer who had the task of supervising the declarations made by local farmers for receiving agricultural subsidies. Later, QGIS was also introduced as a data editor and map publishing platform, along with the improvements of the editing tools and the print composer. Together with other Swiss QGIS users (Solothurn, Thun and CDE (University of Berne)) we coordinate and sponsor the improvements of these tools, along with some improvements in data driven symbolization, automated labeling, attribute handling and forms.\nThe city administration also uses commercial GIS software: Autodesk Topobase, for the capturing and editing of cadastral and waste-water infrastructure data, and GE Smallworld for the management of gas, water and electricity networks. However, these are expert systems in use by specially trained staff. All other GIS projects and the viewing of all data is handled by QGIS.\nIn the second half of 2010, first tests with QGIS server were carried out. In 2011 we introduced a new WebGIS system based on the QGIS WMS server and GeoExt/OpenLayers as the web client. The main reasons for the decision to use QGIS server were the considerable time savings made possible by re-using the existing QGIS desktop project configurations, rather than having to manage parallel Web project configurations. Additional advantages are the rich set of symbolization and labeling options and the consistent map rendering between the Desktop GIS application and the Web-GIS. The QGIS webclient can be tested and used at http://gis.uster.ch/\nToday, QGIS is used for the following GIS projects:\nviewing of waste-water data, integration of additional databases and direct access to canal videos and inspection protocols viewing and editing for monitoring and the environmental and urban planning of the waste water and hydrology systems (german: Genereller Entwässerungsplan) viewing of underground cadastral data (waste water, water, gas and electricity networks, later also telecommunication) (german: Leitungskataster) viewing of cadastral and survey data viewing and editing of the communal inventory of protected natural sites viewing and editing of urban and regional planning data viewing and editing of road infrastructure data viewing statistics generated directly from the database of current and past residents planning and visualization for energy planning (gas supply regions, heat use from waste water, near-surface geothermal energy, block heating stations, etc.) Additional further projects are currently under development.\nIn 2007 it was not entirely clear at what pace QGIS would be further developed and how both community and commercial support would evolve. Today it can be stated that the speed of development and the improvements made by the QGIS community exceeded our expectations. Community and commercial support from the companies Sourcepole and Norbit is excellent. There is a direct communication with developers without being shielded away by a product management or sales team. The developers of these two companies are also lead developers of the QGIS project and have excellent knowledge of the code base.\nBugs are often fixed within hours or days after reporting and new developments are implemented in a short time frame. New features can be tested immediately after development and deployed to the users whenever the quality is good enough for the end user. There is no need to wait for official software releases. We enjoy the freedom of being able to influence the project and to install the software on as many computers we like without having to deal with licensing management. We are looking forward to future collaboration with the QGIS community and our commercial supporters for the advancement of the QGIS project.\nAuthor ¶ Andreas Neumann This article was contributed in April 2011 by Dr. Andreas Neumann.

Headquarter is located at Hyderabad city of India and it has three sub centres at Guwahati, Jaipur and Patna city. Guwahati is capital of Assam State (North Eastern side of country). The NIRD Guwahati Centre is actively involved in short (mostly 5 days including one-day handheld GPS survey) residential GIS trainings for State, District and Block level government officials of eight North-East Indian States. Apart from government officials, University faculties, College lecturers, research scholars and Reputed NGOs are also trained. Trainings are fully sponsored by NIRD and participants are to bear only their travel expenses. The author is working in NIRD Guwahati centre as an Adjunct Faculty (GIS) and coordinating GIS and Rural Development related trainings at the centre along with Dr. K. Haloi, Training \u0026amp; Research coordinator, i/c Head, C-GARD, NIRD\u0026amp;PR-NERC.\nInitially I was involved in conducting GIS trainings with commercial software like ArcGIS and ERDAS. But end of the training programme, participants were not happy due to unavailable of software with them for practice. Then we find the solution with introducing QGIS. After introducing the QuantumGIS, it was felt that the Open Source GIS can fulfil the need of Rural Development sector of India. Accordingly it was introduced in research activities to prepare a base maps like roads, drainage, settlements, delineation of watershed boundary etc. and also to prepare a GPS data downloading, analysis, hyperlinking the field photos of GPS survey etc. Using Google earth plugin we have been introduced to prepare a LULC maps.\nSoftware was then pursued for the personal use for one year and its new versions were checked for the enhanced functionalities. During this whenever author was course coordinator in training, he used QGIS in trainings for introduction and feedbacks.\nQGIS is being used in GIS trainings at the centre. Further it is being messaged and advised in all trainings that no commercial GIS software should be purchased at District (administrative unit in India after Nation and State) and below, if real requirement is not felt and this saving may be used for purchase of hardware like GPSs, computers etc. In the training we have been introduced to participants Georeferencing, database creation, digitization, editing, analysis and print composer etc. After introducing QGIS, we are getting good feedback from various officials and students.\nThere is a question why QGIS only when other software like uDig, MapWindow, gvSIG, GRASS are also there. The answer lies in the facts that QGIS is an OSGeo incubated project, less complex, its development is very fast and associated with huge community of users and developers and lastly authors expertise. With its latest version of 2.4, software is capable of satisfying the all needs of grass root rural development executors in India with satisfying the present queries and wishes for future.\nThe applications of software during training are generally concentrated on Resource Mapping, Rural infrastructure facility mapping, Watershed and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). Watershed and MGNREGS are land based flagships of Government of India. Local Open Source Raster and Vector data are used in exercises. Participants are encouraged to come with their own or departmental data if available to work. Training is provided in lab equipped with 22 computers of i7, 4GB RAM and Windows8 OS. Per training programme number of trainees remains between 20-30.\nTraining course at NIRD\u0026amp;PR-NERC, Guwahati Conducted QGIS training courses and participants ¶ General topics covered are basic introduction to the GIS and QGIS software , major tool bars, plug-in structure, geo-referencing, creation/editing of vector data, clip (Raster/Vector), merge, terrain analysis, contours, .csv to .shp layer, .shp to .kml and vice versa, handling GPS data, Interpolation, table editing/query, field calculator, print composer etc. and some basic analysis on vector data. Apart from introduction to various help links available, a LinkedIn group for participants has been created for post training support. Besides, QGIS based training programmes, QGIS also used in research like georeferncing the maps, database creation, extraction of vector data from toposheets and google earth, editing and analysis, GPS data downloading and process and then layout preparation etc.\nSuccess ¶ Every month training is conducted with 20-30 participants, so this number is increasing every month. Training feedbacks are remaining very positive and encouraging. Certificates are provided to the participants after completion of training. Presently handouts are being supplied to the participants in hard copy and tutorial, software and practice data in soft copies but plan is there to create DVDs containing screen-recorded lectures/demo of various topics in English. In future certificate and diploma programmes may also be initiated.\nAuthors ¶ Alajangi Simhachalam This article was contributed in July 2014 by Alajangi Simhachalam, Adjunct Faculty, NIRD-NERC, Guwahati Website: http://www.nirdnerc.nic.in\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/case-studies/india_guwahati/","tags":null,"title":"Trainings \u0026 Research activities using QGIS at NIRD\u0026PR-NERC, Guwahati, India"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Ukrainian open initiative of creating tools for spatial planning in the QGIS environment ¶ Introduction ¶ Formed in 2018, Julie's Data is a Ukrainian consulting agency delivering open-source solutions to broad public use. We focus mainly on strategic environmental assessment with GIS, urban planning, creating and teaching QGIS courses, and running the crowdsourcing project described below.\nWorking with local communities for the past few years, Julie's Data formed the concept of solving a particular array of public administration problems dictated by the lack of modern geodata management tools. One such problem - is the lack of high-quality, accessible, and legal local geospatial data from cadasters which enables communities to appear on the world investment map and allows them to form a healthy competition of proposals for sustainable development.\nIn February 2022, two days before the full-scale Russian aggression, the Ukrainian government adopted a decree defining the mandatory structure of spatial planning databases - the primary source of filling and running cadastral systems.\nFollowing its open source attitude, at the beginning of June, Julie's Data (https://juliesdata.com/) launched a crowdsourcing initiative aimed to implement the above mentioned structure with open source tools and called to join everyone to the development of GIS-applied tools for spatial planning using QGIS.\nBringing spatial planning tools into life ¶ The initiative received significant feedback from the community - more than 100 applications from those who willed to join from various regions of Ukraine, including Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Poltava, and Vinnytsia regions.\nAs a result, a group of 62 participants of various specialties was formed - architects, geodesists, surveyors, cartographers, GIS specialists, ecologists, scientists, representatives of local government, and others. The participants set a goal to create high-quality spatial planning tools (SPT for convenience) based on the approved geodatabase structure so that every interested person can use them freely and without unnecessary operational costs for solving their tasks - in professional urban planning, scientific, educational, or public activity. Therefore, it was decided to distribute future SPT under the terms of the CC BY-SA license.\nFor the SPT implementation, QGIS was chosen, as it satisfies the two main requirements of the participants: firstly - to ensure each participant has the opportunity to join the work without obstacles, and the second - to give everyone the ability to use the developed SPT without unnecessary barriers and costs. Most of the participants got acquainted with QGIS for the first time during the project and began to use QGIS in their professional work.\nThe initiative group was coordinated by its organizers, with regular meetings where tasks, proposals, questions, and problems that arose during the work were discussed. Most of the communication was in the messenger chat, where constructive discussions were held between the participants in search of the truth.\nThe working group successfully implemented the database in PostgreSQL and GeoPackage formats and created forms for the classes (layers), including the rules for data integrity approved by requirements for the geospatial database, which were set up in QGIS. The symbol library with the rule-based symbology for each class (layers) was set up in the .qgs project file. Layer style settings for each layer were tested and saved into the geospatial database of the SPT.\nAn example of the symbol library Current developments of the initiative group were presented on October 19, 2022, at the open webinar \u0026quot;Free tools for the urban planning documentation development. Presentation of the first stage\u0026quot;, which gathered a broad audience of specialists and community representatives from all over Ukraine.\nDuring webinar project members shared their experience not only about participating in the project but also their own experience of using QGIS and their first achievements of urban planning documentation development with the help of created tools.\nAn example of urban plan created with SPT We understand that for the broad implementation of GIS into governance, Ukraine needs a solid open-source community. So, among other participants, we invited Anita Grazer, who shared her thoughts on how open-source solutions are used by the Austrian local governments and how they form a sustainable, resistant to challenges society.\nThe opinions expressed at the webinar resonated with the listeners, as evidenced by more than 600 requests for obtaining an SPT from architects, land managers, representatives of local authorities, university teachers, and scientists. Anyone can get the current SPT by submitting a web form here: https://juliesdata.com/form/zapit-na-otrimannya-bgd-mistobud. The video recording of the webinar is available on YouTube (https://youtu.be/ZRX1nI5Tkv0/).\nConclusions ¶ Our initiative continues its life and we invite everyone who wants to join it. The most important questions for the next stage are relationships between classes of the geospatial database, tools for topology rules verification, which are required by law, and also to develop a minimum set of SPT functionality for effective work with spatial documentation for local communities.\nIn these times of drastic changes, we see the fragility of societies built upon a centralized data infrastructure when the being of communities depends on the will of infrastructure owners.\nWe believe that our SPT will become one of the applied tools for freedom to explore, create spatial data, and be engaged in political decision-making.\nAuthors ¶ Yuliia Maksymova, candidate of technical sciences, assistant at the geoinformatics and photogrammetry department of KNUBA, co-founder and GIS specialist in Julie's Data, facebook page https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006853998055. email: office@juliesdata.com\nOleksii Boiko, GIS specialist, co-founder at Julie's Data, email: contact@juliesdata.com.\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/case-studies/ukrainian_spt/","tags":null,"title":"Ukrainian open initiative of creating tools for spatial planning in the QGIS environment"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Use of python console to prepare offline map from WMS (tile downloader) ¶ This study explains how to prepare offline maps from WMS/WFS or any map loaded in QGIS map view by downloading tiles with the help of a script in python console. The skript also generates a mosaic of all tiles for further use.\nAccessing raster/vector maps through Web Mapping Service (WMS) service is very common and efficient. It has several advantages such as security, centralized and flexible map styles. Example is Google maps, Yahoo, Bing, MODIS, Landsat, maps published by NASA, NRSC (India). The disadvantage/limitation of WMS is it works via internet or intranet. It may not be possible to get internet connection always especially in the field during survey. Also WMS works slow, compared to any offline image format such as GeoTiff, jpg, img etc.\nUse of QGIS ¶ QGIS provides a tool to connect/access any WMS service. WMS connection is based on simple URL and once connection is established map can be seen on QGIS mapview. If we save the map of visible extent from QGIS mapview as jpg (File \u0026gt; Save as Image) it creates world file which has the geographic coordinate information of particular region E.g. sample.jpg is the map and sample.jpgw have the coordinates. That means the downloaded image is georeferenced. We can download tiles in grid format manually and use later offline. Manual downloading is possible if the area is very small or low resolution images are fine.\nQGIS with WMS tiles Python Console ¶ A short script was written in \u0026ldquo;Python Console\u0026rdquo; with help available on QGIS official website in PyQGIS Developer Cookbook. Script consists of basically 4 components as following,\nX,Y coordinate (top left and bottom right) of first tile Size of tile to be downloaded (e.g. 0.001 X 0.001 degrees) No of tiles to download (calculated based on full extent of map and size of tile) Output directory to store the output tiles/files The script works in two simple for loops first which defines the extent of map in QGIS map view and run row/columns. Once the map extent is set then map is loaded in QGIS. The delay of 3 seconds (depends on internet connection) was introduced before saving map as jpg in user defined directory. Once the script is executed all the tiles created in directory can be directly loaded in QGIS or single mosaic is prepared from Raster \u0026gt; Miscellaneous \u0026gt; Merge or Build Virtual Raster (Catalog). Both tools generates mosaic but basic difference in Merge creates an image independent of tiles whereas Virtual raster generates a link in all individual tiles (tiles are required).\nPython script and directory where tiles are stored The method has limitation that, changes in map at server end will not reflect in offline (downloaded map). In this case user will have to repeat the process and generate new offline map. Second limitation is the offline map created will be image format; it cannot be used for thematic mapping or image classification. With some extra efforts some landuse maps can be converted to vector with some data loss.\nScope ¶ The generated mosaic is pure image even if it is downloaded from thematic map (7-8 color). Using advance tool like reclassification, layer/band stacking this raster can be converted to polygon vector. WMS has several requests such as getcapabilities, getmap, getfeatureinfo etc. Using the getgeatureinfo attribute information for each polygon can be retrieved. The script can be converted to plugin so that anyone without scripting knowledge will be able to use the script.\nConclusion ¶ The above experiences shows that QGIS can be used at any advanced level. With basic programming skills one can write a small script or a plug-in to improve the quality of work and save time. Within QGIS, access to a repository of plug-ins developed worldwide is the best of QGIS. The PyQGIS Developer Cookbook is a great resource to write a script and raster data processing is much easy now with help of GDAL tools.\nAuthors ¶ This article was contributed May 2014 by Prashant Kadgi, based in Pune (India) and currently works as consultant in GIS APP Consultancy Services.

You can find him on Twitter. He also publishes useful HOWTO Videos on Youtube for certain cartographic tasks in QGIS.\nQGIS: Steven, What is the name of the team you work at FT? Can you provide us a little bit of background about what your team at FT is doing?\nSteve: Our team is in a transition period at the moment, we have a new data visualisation editor, Alan Smith OBE (formerly of the ONS) who is shaking things up and creating a single graphics team. Traditionally we had a web graphics team and print graphics team. The print team would be responsible for all the newspaper graphics as well as creating web-friendly versions of them. My team was responsible for all the web-only content, as well as working closely with the interactive producers/developers in designing interactive graphics.\nThe newly formed team will allow for a lot more cross-over of skills between the different media.\nAlan has introduced a single digital workflow for our team, including using d3 to help create a larger graphic vocabulary and cutting down the time it takes to create the visuals.\nExample: Migrant flows. Western Balkans route.\nQGIS: How many co-workers are there in your team?\nSteven: Including all the designers, developers, producers and statisticians we have a team of 24\nQGIS: What's your specific role within the team?\nSteven: We are a multi-disciplinary department so I don\u0026rsquo;t have a specific role as such. My role includes producing responsive designs for interactive graphics as well as doing the front-end development on the less complicated interactives (e.g. Inside Isis Inc: The journey of a barrel of oil). I also produce the standard news related charts and maps on a daily basis. Over the past two years I have been concentrating on developing our cartographic offerings at the FT. QGIS has been instrumental in changing how we produce maps, and in conjunction with other tools such Blender have helped me to be more creative with how we approach maps.\nExample: Animation of Dora's journey from Nigeria to Sicily - one of thousands by trafficked women each year.\nQGIS: Can you tell us a bit about yourself? What's your educational background? What did you do before joining the data visualization team at FT?\nExample: Gotthard rail and road tunnel in the Swiss Alps.\nSteven: I am traditionally trained as scientific illustrator. What\u0026rsquo;s that I hear you ask? It involves producing illustrations for medical journals, natural history publications anything where you are trying to convey information visually where a photograph can\u0026rsquo;t. Think of diagrams showing the human circulatory system, or showing a procedure to fix a broken bone. Sadly there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much call for that kind of work when I left university and I basically fell into the job at the FT. I have always been good at maths, which I think is important when working with data visualisations, it has certainly helped me with my coding as well.\nQGIS: How did you discover QGIS?\nSteven: I came across QGIS in 2013 when we were working on a project mapping the ethnicity of the Middle East\nWe used it to georeference maps that were created by a professor at Columbia University. At first I found it really tricky using the add feature drawing tool, probably because it was unlike anything I\u0026rsquo;d used in Adobe Illustrator for 17 years prior! I also found it frustrating that you had to save things twice, once when done editing the shapefile, then again to save the project. However, this was just down to inexperience with the program and in the end it did exactly what we needed, which was to produce shapefiles that we could add to a Mapbox base map.\nQGIS: What's the role of QGIS within your usual workflows?\nSteven: QGIS is now an integral part of our mapping workflow. I don\u0026rsquo;t use any other GIS tool to create our maps. Although a few members of our team also use Map Publisher as they feel more comfortable staying within Adobe Illustrator. I would say 80% of our maps are now produced in QGIS.\nExample: Public Lands in the US.\nQGIS: What other tools do you use besides QGIS and how do you combine these?\nSteven: If it is just a straightforward locator map 95% of the work is done in QGIS, with the final polishing done in Adobe Illustrator.\nIf I am doing a relief map, then the process is a lot more complex. I will retrieve DEM files from Nasa Earth Explorer, and bring them into QGIS to crop to size. I will then take the cropped DEM into Blender to create a 3D render. If I am using a satellite overlay on the hillshading then I will download a BlueMarble image from Nasa and take this into Blender as well. The exported render from Blender is then brought back into QGIS to use as a background layer. I may tweak it in Photoshop beforehand if necessary.\nFor responsive maps like those in the Isis oil story, I used all of the above tools but the final step is to use an open source Adobe Illustrator script developed by the New York Times\u0026rsquo; Archie Tse. This allows me to create responsive versions of my maps that work on all devices.\nAnother tool that is useful is Google My Maps which allows reporters around the world to mark locations on a map and then we can download them as a kmz file and import them straight into QGIS.\nThe final tool I use is Adobe After Effects as I have recently got into animating my maps to take the user on a journey. As used in the Land Rush series recently:\nLand Rush Ethiopia Land Rush Myanmar Land Rush Indonesia QGIS: Do you use other spatial tools or GIS besides QGIS, and if yes, which ones?\nSteven: QGIS all the way for me, but as mentioned above some of my colleagues use Map Publisher as well.\nExample: Strikes on Syria in February 2016.\nQGIS: Can you describe the strengths and weaknesses of QGIS regarding the tasks you have to do?\nSteven: When I first used QGIS I saw it as a specialist tool, fit for only dealing with specific tasks. I really didn\u0026rsquo;t see it a production tool. In late 2014 two of my colleagues went on a QGIS course held by Alasdair Rae at Sheffield University. They both enthused about how good QGIS was, so I took it upon myself to evaluate it as a tool that could be used to produce all our maps.\nWithin about two weeks I was convinced that it would be viable. The main selling point was the ability to set up style guides for everything including zoom level styling for street-level maps.\nI have a system set up where we have sets of Google sheets with columns for name, lat, long, marker-icon, fontweight, fontsize and whether you want the marker visible or not.\nThe marker icon is a dropdown connected to a vLookUp table which fills in all the details for that marker.\nSo all I have to do is download the csv, import it into QGIS, apply a style and I have a map that is 95% ready to go.\nTo be perfectly honest I can\u0026rsquo;t think of any weaknesses, there are a couple of things that I would like to see or be able to do but, I don\u0026rsquo;t see that as a weakness, just a missing feature.\nExample: Urban Attraction and Migration within China.\nQGIS: What are the concepts or features you like the most in QGIS?\nSteven: There are numerous features that I would class as life savers! But primarily Quick OSM and Georeferencer have saved me so much time, this is absolutely essential when deadlines are tight. Which, when working for a news organisation, is usually 90% of the time.\nExample: Urban Attraction and Migration within China. Detail views.\nQGIS: What features or functionality in QGIS do you miss the most? Do you have a list of missing features that would help you a lot if implemented?\nSteven: A couple of things I would like to see in future versions are...\nBezier curve support, this would be particularly useful in conjunction with Georeferencer. I know there is a spline plugin but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you the full control a bezier curve would.\nBeing able to save as image at larger file sizes. Currently this is the only way I can create a georeferenced crop of a DEM file to take into Blender. But it is limited to the size of your screen. If I had an 8,000 pixel DEM file loaded into QGIS I would like to be able to export the crop at a larger size than my screen for use in HD video for example.\nQGIS: If you miss certain features in QGIS that would help you - would you consider improving QGIS yourself (with coding in QGIS core or Python plugins), or would you consider to hire a QGIS developer to implement the missing feature for you? Or would you instead look for other tools to fill in that gap?\nSteven: I certainly don\u0026rsquo;t have the necessary skills to do the coding myself, I\u0026rsquo;m fairly proficient in Javascript but would struggle with Python. I would love to hire a developer to get features implemented but unfortunately I\u0026rsquo;m not in control of any budgets, so I use other tools to get around this.\nExample: Percentage of households with a broadband internet subscription in the US.\nQGIS: Let's talk about user experience - the QGIS team is aware that there are various places in the UI (dialogs, panels, etc) that could be improved a lot. Can you tell us a little bit where in the UI you see the biggest potential for a UI overhaul?\nSteven: I think the main tools are fine as they are, once you are familiar with them they\u0026rsquo;re pretty obvious. However, one thing I do find a little frustrating is trying to hunt down a plugin once it\u0026rsquo;s been installed. They either create their own menu (MMQGIS), live under one of the menus (Georeferencer) or create their own icon (threejs). It would be handy to have a plugin window that has all installed plugins in it. Again this isn\u0026rsquo;t a deal breaker but would make it easier than hunting in several different locations.\nQGIS: Thank you for your time and the work you do for promoting and documenting workflows in QGIS!\nPortrait of Steve Bernard. Interactive Design Editor at Financial Times.\nSteven: A pleasure, I\u0026rsquo;m almost evangelical about QGIS! Hence the 31 video tutorials and always happy to spread the word.\nInterview questions by A. Neumann and T. Sutton.

MIDES is also accountable for the coordination -at both sectoral and territorial levels- articulation, monitoring, supervision and evaluation of plans, programs and projects, within the areas of its competence, aiming at the consolidation of a progressive redistributive social policy.\nThe National Division of Evaluation and Monitoring (DINEM ) is a section of MIDES that oversees the monitoring and evaluation of plans, programs, actions, devices and social projects through the national territory. DINEM also produces and manages necessary information to improve their design and implementation.\nThe Department of Geography of DINEM is responsible for the production, management and analysis of geographical information,\nQGIS at the Department of Geography of the DINEM ¶ Ever since the consolidation of the Department of Geography in 2012, we have tried to incorporate open source software to fulfill our duties. In particular, the management of an extensive field work, consisting in the annual implementation of approximately 40,000 visits to socially vulnerable households throughout the country. The objective was to conform a thorough georeferenced database of target households, in order to improve social policies implementation. Particularly, data was collected to enhance the scope of monetary transfer programs (\u0026quot;Asignaciones Familiares \u0026ndash; Plan de Equidad\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Tarjeta Uruguay Social\u0026quot;). The survey form applied contemplates social, housing, and environmental aspects.\nLogistics to viabilize such fieldwork involved using statistical packages to manage the database generated, together with an intensive use of GIS to organize field trips and georeference relieved data.\nQGIS at work: identifying houses on informal settlements to implement fieldwork Although proprietary software was implemented when the working process started, the development of the tasks themselves gradually demanded it to be converted to open source software. As the process as a whole became more computerized -incorporating a workflow engine and a PostGIS geospatial database-, license requirements and benefits offered by free and open source software (FOSS) options encouraged us to make the change. In that way, as the QGIS project was refined (fewer bugs and more functionalities), we were able to satisfy our needs using QGIS. PostGIS associated tools allowed the workgroup to rapidly coordinate the tasks needed to viabilize daily field trips, together with subsequent analysis tasks on the same data fieldwork generated, shortly after it was relieved and digitized.\nQGIS at work: Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital and most populated city, overlayed with PostGIS layer showing to-do visits (mostly composed of socially vulnerable households, in the outskirts of the city) In addition to information management and field work implementation, we constantly use QGIS typical geospatial tools to produce tematic cartography, and in spatial analysis tasks. This last, as much about the data that the fieldwork generates, as with other ministry programs information, and frequently even to aid interinstitutional projects. With \u0026quot;qgis2web\u0026quot; we were able to produce interactive maps, which have become the main way to communicate the results of such investigations. They allow human resources within other programs and agencies to easily and effectively manage higher amounts of information than with a collection of static maps, even when these resources are not used to reading spatial data.\nConclusion ¶ QGIS has become a fundamental software to the Department of Geography at DINEM. It presents an excellent performance to work with heavy files and to interact with PostGIS and with our workflow engine. This allows us to have an excellent management of geographic data, which also makes for the production of basemaps and thematic cartographies of superior quality.\nAt the same time, extra features that are incorporated through plugins are of great value to us. For instance, the possibility of exporting \u0026quot;leaflet\u0026quot; map viewers, as well as incorporating high resolution satellite imagery directly into the GIS work area through \u0026ldquo;OpenLayers\u0026rdquo; to manually vectorize information, among others.\nThis variety of options is precisely what has allowed us to develop the specific and at the same time very different technical solutions that programs and agencies have been needing through past years.As mentioned in this article, we can state that QGIS meets the necessary requirements to be used in public administration as desktop GIS software. Also it has been a cornerstone in helping this institution to set up a web map, offering general population much information about social issues (SIG MIDES, OpenLayers based WEB GIS developed by the IT division).\nAuthors ¶ Guillermo D'Angelo - Head of the Geography Department (DINEM-MIDES, Uruguay).

This demands not only a change in people's way of thinking (sometimes molded by advertising), but also a sustainable management of expenses and, indirectly, fighting against software piracy. These advantages which are inherent to the philosophy of the Open Source software will be the model to follow if we want a quality education without boundaries or dependencies of any kind. From this perspective, class 35 of the 12th grade belonging to the technological course of territory and environment at Jaime Moniz Secondary School, uses QGIS to develop activities proposed in Geographical Information Systems, Applied Information Systems and during their training period. Within the range of options of free GIS, there were three underlying reasons for the choice of Open Source selection: the user friendly and intuitive approach, supported by online information provided by forums; the several software plug-ins and the quality of the product in its final stage. (One should bear in mind that these academic works were done by students who belong to a very young age group.)\nThe Project —— Expectation ¶ Expectation was the most dominating feeling in the firth lessons! The group of students had only a theoretical and somewhat vague knowledge about the issue of GIS. It was, therefore, necessary to link practical activities to that theoretical knowledge - at first, through the gathering of geographical information by using a support map, within the school's perimeter, and later, by using a GPS, concerning the area surrounding the school. In figures 1 and 2 it is possible to view some of the activities developed in class.\nDistribution of dustbins (green) and garden benches (yellow) at Jaime Moniz Secondary School At present, some students are still using the QGIS to make different work plans during their training period. In figure 3, a student's work stands out: it is related to the distribution regarding the number of the inhabitants of Santo António, including a placement proposal for recycle containers, in a parish of Funchal.\nFunctional map of an area in the old part of the town of Funchal, surrounding Jaime Moniz Secondary School Decision for QGIS ¶ Generally speaking, QGIS allured the students: \u0026ldquo;to accomplish basic functions of GIS through exercise associations of graphic and non-graphic elements\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;to upload alphanumeric data\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;use functions of spacial analysis\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;to make thematic maps\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;to make a Digital Elevation Model\u0026rdquo; and, last but not least, \u0026ldquo;to recognize the relevance of a free GIS for the analysis of geographical information, as well for the sustainable management of the territory\u0026rdquo;. These theoretical and practical purposes are achieved together along with other goals, extremely important in the education context, such as: \u0026ldquo;creating a diversified educational experience\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;being in contact with local reality\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;developing a constructive, positive and critical mind\u0026rdquo;.\nFrom the class room to the education community ¶ The idea of creating a website: http://www.sig-na-jaime-moniz.webnode.pt implied two main purposes: \u0026ldquo;spreading the word about project works done by the students\u0026rdquo; and, simultaneously, \u0026ldquo;show the importance of Open Source QGIS for the accomplishment of these school works\u0026rdquo;. At present, the website is a motivation source for the follow up of the whole teaching process.\nPlacement proposal for recycle containers in the parish of Santo António Conclusion ¶ In a flashback analysis of the whole process, I feel that the idea of using QGIS, as a tool, to accomplish some teaching purposes, was an excellent choice. At first, its use involved a lot of expectation. I had never used GIS before and, therefore, I was learning and teaching at the same time. The fact that the GIS turned out to be extremely user friendly together, with the information available online, was a blessing for me. Moreover, the school did not have to pay for another software license nor it was dependent on license renewals, which substantially improved the teaching quality, without any extra expenses. At present, students use QGIS almost on their own to accomplish their different work plans. I hope the final result shows the amount of effort involved in the whole learning process.\nReferences ¶ http://sitio.dgidc.min-edu.pt http://www.sres.pt/?page=drgc_loc_atend\u0026separador=6\u0026buttons=1 http://www.sig-na-jaime-moniz.webnode.pt Author ¶ Fátima Vale This article was elaborated in March 2011 by Fátima Vale with the support of Luís Antunes (supervisor of the students in the DRIGOT).

The LecosS plugin ¶ This case study results from the final draft of the Graduate Geographic Information Systems taught by GeoPoint. We proposed to study a landscape using Landscape Ecology plugin (LecoS) in QGIS 2.01 Dufour. The study was conduted in a region of central Portugal, Municipality of Coimbra, with an total area of 31940ha and it has geographic coordinates 40°12'11.84\u0026quot; North, 8°24'37.15\u0026quot; West. Because the new administrative reorganization this municipality are divided into 18 parishes, which are mostly urban areas (Figure 1).\nGeographic location of the municipality of Coimbra. The characterization of a landscape is conducted using quantitative indices designed by landscape metrics. These indices are then used to describe the structural characteristics of landscape, to document the change and their relationship with the occurrence of several species or group of species (Turner et al, 2001;. Olsen et al, 2007;. Fidalgo et al. , 2009). The number of metrics is extremely large and can be calculated at the landscape level, class and stain (Turner et al, 2001;. Fidalgo et al, 2009.). Metrics can be calculated from the Corine Land Cover, Land use (COS 90 and COS2006) or maps of Land cover produced by us. According to Martin Jung (2012), the Landscape Ecology Stistics (Lecos) is a module of QGIS used to calculate landscape metrics in raster layers. The result can be available in CSV format.\nMethods ¶ Landscape metrics was calculated using the Corine Land Cover (CLC) of the years 1990 and 2006. For this purpose it was necessary to transform the coverages in raster format with cell size 50x50 meters. We use r.to.raster tool the Grass Gis module that were present in processing toolbox and the CLC classification level used it´s the first. After transform coverages we calculate the metrics in Landscape Ecology plugin (LecoS) using the graphical modeler (Figure 2).\nLandscape metrics calculated for diferent years (1990 and 2006). We calculate land cover area, Landscape Proportion, edge density, Number of patches, Greatest patch area, Smallest patch area , Mean patch distance and the Effective mesh size (Table 1). Measures of diversity of the landscape were calculated the Shannon index, Uniformity and the Simpson index.\nResults ¶ From analysis of the landscape metrics calculated it was found that there was an increase in the degree of human disturbance and therefore a greater fragmentation of uses between 1990 and 2006. The number of patches of \u0026ldquo;Forest Semi Natural areas\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Agricultural areas\u0026rdquo; decreased between 1990 and 2006 (Table 1). This metric can give us some indication of ecological processes increasing or decreasing relationships between populations and habitats (Viana and Aranha, 2008). Also of note is the average distance between spots, one measure that allows us to understand the degree of landscape fragmentation, the decline of \u0026ldquo;Forest and Semi Natural areas\u0026rdquo; 1990 to 2006 at the expense of increased \u0026ldquo;Artificial areas\u0026rdquo; (Table 1).\nModel to calculate landscape metrics in 1990. From 1990 to 2006 diversity increased, however it is known that this result is directly related to the transfer between land cover, in particular loss of \u0026ldquo;Agricultural areas\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Forest and Semi Natural areas\u0026rdquo;. The same happened with uniformity.\nConclusion ¶ It was possible to determine the landscape metrics using the LecoS plugin noting that the study area presents problems of fragmentation due to the high degree of human disturbance. QGIS proved to be quite intuitive and very practical in the calculation of landscape metrics in the absence of any constraint. It is indeed a robust and viable compared to proprietary software solution. In the future we intend to apply this method to areas that have problems with invasive species to study their behavior in the landscape.\nReferences ¶ Fidalgo, B., R. Salas, et al.

The LecosS plugin"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Using QGIS for FTTH/GPON network planning due to the implementation European Digital Agenda ¶ Definition of the problem ¶ Over the past few years many EU countries have launched operational programs to implement European Digital Agenda (EAC) developed by the European Commission in 2010. According to its guidelines until 2020 every citizen of the European Union should have access to 30 Mbps Internet bandwidth and at least half of them will have access to bandwidth not slower than 100 Mbps.\nPoland is one of the countries in which the Agenda is being implemented. Thanks to European Union funds many local operators can compete with large telecom providers as regards high-speed broadband services. Unfortunately, applying for funding requires a great deal of work necessary to draw up proper documentation, including, among other things, development of planned FTTH (Fiber To The Home) network conceptual maps.\nMoreover, currently there are no GIS-based IT tools available to support the potential beneficiaries with the preparation of documentation. The complexity of the problem is even more complicated by the fact that such a software should enable a creation of documentation in accordance with specific program guidelines (e.g. the obligation to connect educational institutions).\nAs we have extensive experience in the telecommunications industry, entities applying for EU funds asked us to create software supporting the development of FTTH network concept map. Products generated by developed software was to significantly speed up the application preparation process.\nDescription of the solution ¶ Due to the high popularity, widespread availability, openness of the software and immense functional abilities, it felt natural to select QGIS as platform to serve as a basis for our solution.\nAccording to the guidelines of FTTH Council Europe, it is crucial to first prepare a plan considering both the technical aspect (placement of cables, splice closures, splitters) and economic aspect (demand) based on real address points data. The building structure and the density of the building development determine the technology of GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) network design. To have the ability to plan network topology efficiently it is required to have among other things:\naccess to GIS data, automation of GIS data processing, application of network optimization algorithms, application of GPON network engineering rules. All these items were connected in QGIS platform. Below there is a brief description of how we realized the project and what functional items were incorporated to create one solution.\nIn order to achieve our goal, we needed few functional components apart from the standard GIS platform:\nGRASS - a collection of vector and network algorithms, QGIS plugins - OpenLayer, QuickOSM, Scipy Point Clustering, WorkContextTracer (our plugin), QGIS modeler \u0026ndash; tool for graphical flow modelling, SpatiaLite - a local database for storing input and output data. The entire solution was based on the concept of so called wizards which realize the process of preparing the FTTx network technical concept step by step. Using 'geoprocessing' modeller, we created models requiring only the necessary input data from operator. Algorithmic complexity was encapsulated within models in the form of designed flow, which use existing QGIS algorithms and calls dedicated scripts.\nTo prevent the results of subsequent analyses from getting mixed up, we provided a plugin called WorkContextTracer which groups our work in so called work contexts.\nNetwork algorithms based on the graph functions available in GRASS were enriched by adding the telecommunication scripts. We introduced a concept of demand clustering which enables to use both K-means and hierarchical methods to aggregate demand points.\nGeoprocessing scripts with usage of cable routing layer and Djikstra algorithm develops a cable route proposal with optical fiber nodes' locations.\nOperators also needed an association between created network nodes and address points to estimate the individual cost of each network branch. To complete this task, we created scripts that performs this operation storing results in local SpatiaLite database. The data needed to be exportable to spreadsheet, so we used free software library to fulfil this requirement.\nHow users used tool to create FTTH/GPON network plan ¶ The user started work by opening a new work context and specifying an input layer of address points to be analysed. Using the standard QGIS interface, the user could establish a set of demands on address points and finally provide the parameters necessary for further steps of the algorithm.\nWithout having information about the existing civil infrastructure, a properly filtered OpenStreet road network were used as a routing layer. Scipy algorithms fed with input parameters, clustered the address points into demand aggregates marking them with separate colour indicating its assignment to particular cluster.\nHaving all address points clustered, user initiated the steps of high level network planning providing layers prepared in the previous steps and a layer with GPON network starting point.\nUpon the completion of the algorithm, in QGIS there are geometry objects representing planned cables and splice closure locations. Basing on demand data and network topology, an additional information is stored in database such as the length of the cable, its profile, node\u0026rsquo;s serving areas.\nAt this stage, the user already had all pieces of the information to develop a high level FTTx network technical concept. The final part was generation of the data report spreadsheet showing all calculated data from several different perspectives.\nConclusion ¶ Thanks to the use of the QGIS platform as well as its extension capabilities, we managed to develop a free open source solution allowing telecommunication operators to prepare the documents necessary to submit application for co-financing in the EU program implementing European Digital Agenda.\nBy combining flexible vector algorithms with the telecom engineering scripts, we enabled the practical use of mathematical algorithms in solving real problems concerning telecommunication network planning. The user operates on understandable data scope (municipality, building, road) whereas transformation of this information into a mathematical model is hidden from the user.\nThe user got many useful benefits:\nAutomatic GPON network plan development based on publicly available data and GPON technology engineering rules. Ability to customize tool with specific EU program guidelines in a given country. The big accuracy of the results corresponding to real dimensions. Generation of data needed for applying for EU funds: network concept map, cable and splice closure report with serving areas assignment. Possibility to precisely determine the construction and depreciation costs of each part of the network with calculation of the cost of connecting each address point. Possibility to prioritize address points from the most profitable to unprofitable. Possibility to evaluate basic economic indicators like ROI, NPV.

And as many other italian municipality it manages the town planning; in particular the urban planning and what we call \u0026ldquo;recovery plan\u0026rdquo; aka PDR —— Piani Di Recupero. This urbanistic tool is dedicated to the historical area in the center of the town and it requires a specific study: building state of conservation, intended use, particular historical notice via survey and restitution to produce planimetric and prospectus graphics. For this purpose it has used QGIS in addition to Postgresql/Postgis database, PHP code and Libreoffice suite, QCAD (LibreCAD).\nThe task ¶ Workflow Schema A schema will clarify the workflow:\nEvery building data was retrieved via survey and written in paper schedule. Once in office the data were inputed into the Postgresql/Postgis database via PHP form using canonical web browser (Firefox, Iceweasel as well). In a second moment the shape of every building was draw with QGIS and linked to the survey table via id key field (PostgreSQL/Postgis view).\nAt the same time the facades of buildings were designed using QCAD (LibreCAD).\nThe PDR (piani di recupero) must follow strict rules that require specific graphics:\nPresent state Project state Intended use (present) Intended use (project) Type of intervention admitted For every graphic thematic maps were produced using the attribute and data retrieve during the survey (for the present state) and data modified during the study and design fase.\nThus a photo was linked to every building facilitating the design and analisys in the gis project (using the \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; feature). The SQL tools (pgquery, postgis manager, dbmanager et al.) allowed to obtain very sophisticated query immediately viewable in the map canvas such as: volume calculation split by building intended use, standards area calculation in percentage of the total planning area and other minor queries. All useful items for the design and planning study otherwise not possible without a very strength tool like gis (and QGIS in particular).\nQGIS project with building data viewing Finally a synthesis report for every building were produced using libreoffice suite. The report consists in a schedule summarise with photo, cartography extract which localize the building in the contest and data of the present state.\nQGIS print composer for final graphic layout Conclusion ¶ The strength of QGIS is the very user friendly interface coupled with the several tools it offers. The connection with vary data formats (shape files, spatialite db, postgresql/postgis db,...) facilitates and increases the interoperability between different worlds. And thus the freedom offered by the free software (QGIS, PHP, Libreoffice, QCAD) stimulates and open new horizons.\nAnd last but not least: we worked on different platform (Windows 7 64 bit, Windows xp 32 bit, Debian server and Debian client) but we never encountered insurmountable problems.\nAuthor ¶ Flavio Rigolon This article was contributed May 2012 by Flavio Rigolon.

In February 2012, it held a two-day workshop for the Ecology and Protection (anti-poaching) staff of the Udzungwa Mountains National Park, along with members of the Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Centre.\nAbout the Training ¶ Trainees used their own laptops and were provided with the installer for QGIS 1.7.3 along with key data layers covering the National Park: protected area boundaries, scanned topographic maps, a DEM, roads, ranger posts, and habitat types.\nQGIS Udzungwa By the end of the two days, everyone was able to add GPS download data, create and edit new layers, save map projects, design print composers, and save graphics files for inclusion in reports and presentations —— this last feature is specially useful in using GIS to help in normal workflows. Even during the course, National Park staff were using the GIS to view the GPS locations of new-reported elephant carcass locations —— the result of poaching —— and to start planning responses.\nQGIS offered us several attractions: not only is it completely free, but its open source nature makes it responsive to particular development needs; it runs well on older computers and has a relatively small installer; and in general we have found it user-friendly for newcomers to GIS.\nThe Udzungwa Elephant Project is based next to Tanzania's Udzungwa Mountains National Park, a range of evergreen forested mountains reaching over 2,500 metres. It studies the ecology of elephants in and around the mountains, with the aim of understanding how elephants move between different Tanzanian parks and reserves, and how such corridors might be maintained while reducing crop damage caused by elephants. More widely, elephants are a \u0026quot;flagship species\u0026quot; for the conservation of the incredible wildlife and landscapes of southern Tanzania.\nQGIS Udzungwa 2 Special thanks to the US Fish and Wildlife Service African Elephant Fund for supporting this training.\nLinks ¶ http://www.facebook.com/pages/Udzungwa-Elephant-Project/157164174392263 http://udzungwa.wildlifedirect.org/2012/02/10/qgis-training-for-park-staff/ http://www.udzungwacentre.org/ Author ¶ Nick McWilliam This article was contributed in March 2012 by Nick McWilliam.

Presently HABEaS WebGIS covers the south of Portugal, but by the end of 2012/early 2013 it will be expanded to the north of Portugal and also to the Tuzla Canton in Bosnia \u0026amp; Herzegovina. In the long run we want to expand this tool to the entire Mediterranean Basin.\nSince the main goal of this tool is to promote free and easy access to information on biodiversity and ecosystem services we decided to use only free and open source software, that any person or entity can use regardless of their location or financial constraints. The website where HABEaS WebGIS is hosted on a server that runs Debian Linux and was developed with Drupal CMS. PostgreSQL/PostGIS was used to store the data and QGIS was used to process and analyze the GIS that we obtained from several entities. We used both QGIS's native tools but also GRASS GIS and SAGA GIS tools through the GRASS plugin and SEXTANTE Toolbox.\nThe geographic information contained in HABEaS has also been used by WWF to provide support for the identification of High Conservation Value Forests (HCVF) in the south of Portugal, which is a mandatory step for landowners that want their forests to receive Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Certification.\nTo determine which conservation values occure in each property we used SEXTANTE Modeller to create a script that intersects all HABEaS layers with the boundaries of the property. Using the same tool we were also able to create a script that automatically calculates the amount of carbon that is currently stored in each property.\nConclusions ¶ QGIS is easy to use and has very powerful geoprocessing capabilities. The integration of GRASS GIS and SAGA GIS tools through SEXTANTE Toolbox allowed us to perform a number of complex spatial analyzes and to pipeline them using SEXTANTE Modeler. It was also very easy to produce high quality maps with the new Print Composer and to export them in SVG format for further editing with Inkscape which is a powerful open source vector graphics editor.\nIn general, our experience with QGIS has been very positive, the software runs smoothly and the community is very active and supportive. Reported bugs are usually resolved shortly after being reported by users and QGIS developers are always willing to listen to \u0026ldquo;end user's\u0026rdquo; needs and suggestions.\nAuthor ¶ Filipe Dias Filipe Dias is a PhD student at the Center for Applied Ecology (Instituto Superior de Agronomia, Techinical University of Lisbon) and a consultant of the Mediterranean Programme of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).\n","permalink":"https://qgis.org/ja/project/case-studies/portugal_lisbon/","tags":null,"title":"Using QGIS to Map Hotspot Areas for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (HABEaS)"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Using the processing toolbox to automate snow classification ¶ Snowy Hydro Limited (SHL) is a peak electricity generator based in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. Despite owning a variety of generation assets across the country, Snowy Hydro Limited is best known for the custodianship of an iconic piece of Australian infrastructure, the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Scheme.\nThe Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Scheme, is made possible by seasonal snow falls in the New South Wales alpine region. Water from the spring snow melt is used to generate electricity addressing peak demand in the national electricity market, while also diverting water to the drier inland areas of South Eastern Australia for irrigation and agriculture.\nClassifying snow cover over the winter months allows SHL to monitor the life cycle of the snow covered area, archive coverage areas for historical records, and provide coverage statistics to the hydrographic services team for water yield and storage forecasts.\nMap 1.1 Snowy Water Catchment Map Background ¶ Each year during the winter months (1st June to the 31st October) SHL obtains as many cloud free images as possible from the MODIS Terra (EOS AM) satellite. These images are then ingested into an algorithm known as the Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI), which is used to indicate areas where snow is present. While this algorithm is not unique to any one particular sensor, the MODIS instrument was chosen due to its adequate spatial resolution and daily coverage of the project area (Map 1.1 Snowy Water Catchment).\nAim ¶ The aim of this project is to automate the NDSI workflow as a model in the QGIS processing toolbox. The required output is a vector polygon showing the snow covered extent within the Snowy Water Catchment, along with attribution describing the total area covered in square kilometres.\nMethod ¶ The NDSI algorithm itself is quite simple (show below in Formula 1.1 - Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI)) and the subsequent steps required to extract snow cover in a vector format also lends itself nicely to a processing toolbox model.\nFormula 1.1 - Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) This NDSI algorithm will return results between -1 and 1, with the threshold for snow typically being values greater than 0.4. An example of the NDSI output is shown below (Map 1.3 - NDSI output), alongside a natural colour image (Map 1.2 - MODIS true colour) for the 13th July 2014. As seen from these images the NDSI output is very good at discriminating snow covered areas from other land cover types and clouds. It can however misclassify portions of large water bodies as snow, caused by water having absorption characteristics in the Near Infrared part of the spectrum. This characteristic of the NDSI indicates the need to incorporate a water mask at some stage in the model.\nMap 1.2 - MODIS true colour Map 1.3 - NDSI output Map 1.4 - Recoded \"Snow\" vs \"Non snow\" The NDSI output is created with some very simple band map by using the GRASS module \u0026quot;r.mapcalculator\u0026quot;. Once the NDSI grid was available the NDSI threshold of 0.4 needed to be applied and this would result in a boolean grid depicting \u0026quot;Snow\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Non snow\u0026quot; areas. To get that classification another GRASS module \u0026quot;r.recode\u0026quot; was used and produced the result shown above in Map 1.4 Recoded \u0026lsquo;Snow\u0026rsquo; vs \u0026lsquo;Non Snow\u0026rsquo;.\nThe recoded grid was then converted to a vector polygon dataset and the snow covered areas were extracted (shown below, Map 1.5 - Extracted snow). The snow covered areas were then clipped to the Snowy Water Catchment (shown below, Map - 1.6 Snow inside the SWC), then the large water bodies are masked out (shown below, Map 1.7 - Final snow covered area), and finally the area statistics for the snow covered area is generated.\nMap 1.5 - Extracted Snow Map 1.6 - Snow inside the SWC Map 1.7 - Final snow covered area The output from the model is a vector polygon showing the snow covered area within the Snowy Water Catchment. The attributes of the polygon include the area covered by the snow and the percentage of the catchment that is covered. The model in its entirety can be seen below in \u0026quot;Image 1.1 - Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) QGIS processing toolbox model\u0026quot;.\nImage 1.1 - Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) QGIS processing toolbox model Results/Conclusion ¶ The QGIS processing toolbox is a powerful way to automate a workflow such as this snow classification. The model shown above successfully automates the snow classification process, and delivers a GIS dataset that can be used for visualisation and input into further statistical applications. It successfully removes subjective user error associated with previous methods used by SHL, while providing a repeatable and consistent classification tool. Some seasonal results can be viewed here.\nAuthor ¶ Andrew Jeffrey is a GIS Analyst with Snowy Hydro Limited based in Cooma NSW, Australia.

The WOIS has been developed under the TIGER-NET project, which is a major component of the TIGER initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA) and whose main goal is to support the African Earth observation capacity for water resource monitoring. TIGER-NET aims to support the satellite-based assessment and monitoring of water resources from watershed to cross-border basin levels through the provision of a free and powerful software package, with associated capacity building, to African authorities.\nSystem Description ¶ The WOIS can be seen as a multipurpose system consisting of a spatial database, facilities for extracting and processing EO data, and integrative tools and models aimed at decision support e.g. hydrological modelling and GIS-embedded visualization and analysis tools. The WOIS is designed around QGIS, which acts as the front-end Graphical-User-Interface (GUI). QGIS was chosen as the central integrating platform, due to its clear and accessible GUI, strong development community, ease of implementing additional functionalities through Python plugins and its high level of interoperability with major GIS data formats through the use of the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL/OGR) library.\nMoreover, the integrated Processing Toolbox, formerly known as SEXTANTE, brings the ability to easily incorporate geoprocessing algorithms from various applications into QGIS. It acts as a joint repository for a wide range of algorithms, some native to QGIS and others imported from external applications, such as GRASS GIS or the Orfeo Toolbox. Support for algorithms from ESA\u0026rsquo;s BEAM, NEST and Sentinel-1 Toolbox software and for setting up and executing SWAT based hydrological models was added to the Processing Toolbox during the WOIS development. The toolbox also allows for easy incorporation of custom R and Python scripts. The inputs and outputs of the Processing Toolbox algorithms can be evaluated with the QGIS capabilities of data I/O, rendering or map creation.\nA key advantage of the Processing Toolbox is the ability to seamlessly use functionalities from different algorithm providers for data processing and analysis. This can be used to create automatic processing models and, through a QGIS plugin developed during the TIGER-NET project, to sequentially combine algorithms from the different providers into wizard-based processing chains. This functionality was used to create a library of standardized workflows (with instructions) for performing common but complex tasks related to EO data analysis within water resource management.\nThe WOIS graphical user interface, including the embedded workflow library (center) and wizard-based processing workflow (right) The operational and practical use of the WOIS to support integrated water resource management in Africa has been demonstrated via a series of user specific demonstration cases covering a wide range of themes and information products. These include: lake water quality; flood monitoring; land degradation and land cover characterization; water bodies mapping and hydrological modelling. The demonstration cases have several stages. First, customized end-to-end processing workflows are developed for the requested products and applications. Those workflows are subsequently used for product derivation over significant areas and time periods as requested by the users. In the final step, the workflows (i.e. their stability/performance and ease of use) as well as the product outcomes are being evaluated in close dialogue with the users.\nSentinel-1 flood monitoring of Caprivi flood plain, Namibia. Conclusion ¶ The development of the WOIS represents a successful example of a user-driven and collaborative development model, where functionalities have been designed, developed and evaluated through user-designated cases in order to demonstrate the real impact of the system on enhancing water management and integrated water resource management plans. The WOIS is already implemented in major African river basin authorities, several African ministries and agencies, as well as in research and humanitarian organizations. It will therefore continue to develop in response to continued user requirements for new functionalities and functional improvements and due to general software, algorithm and method enhancements.\nA particular focus will be on ensuring the support and implementation of processing capacity for the new Sentinel satellite system by integrating the ESA Sentinel toolboxes into WOIS and developing dedicated production workflows. The next release of WOIS (due in the second half of April 2015) will already incorporate Sentinel-1 Toolbox and a number of workflows utilizing this new radar dataset for flood monitoring, water body mapping, etc. This will turn WOIS into a fully-operational monitoring system. Through provision of this license-free, powerful and extendable system, and through continued capacity building and training efforts, the project thrives to build the basis for an extension, i.e. roll-out to other countries and regions in Africa and beyond.\nReferences ¶ Bauer-Gottwein, P., Jensen, I.

So, what we wanted was to have all this information available, organized and in a common format with the purpose of being able to provide and display it over the Internet.\nConnecting to the Spatial Data Infrastructure with WMS That's how it was developed the Sistema de Información Territorial Estatal en Línea, with the main target to build a spatial data infrastructure which allows our government agencies to share this kind of information to be included in their own projects as health, security or mobility.\nDecision for QGIS ¶ I decided to use Mapserver and PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension to be able to deliver our satellite imagery, orthopothos, digital elevation models and vector information with Web Map Services, thinking that any application will consume our services. But the problem was that many of the commercial and free applications don\u0026rsquo;t work with OGC standards, specially with WFS. After exploring many geographic information systems, I realized that QGIS was the only one which can connect to WMS, WCS and WFS successfully.\nWhat we use QGIS for ¶ Internally, we use QGIS to check the raster and vector data of the agencies before publishing it, and after its integration, we used it again to test the Web services that we\u0026rsquo;ve created. Also, we have done many spatial analysis with QGIS pulling the data directly from our PostgreSQL spatial database, then, we export the results as shape files.\nConnecting to the Spatial Data Infrastructure with WFS We\u0026rsquo;re encouraging our users to download QGIS and link directly with our Sistema de Información Territorial Estatal en Línea, mainly because it fully supports OGC standards and has many interesting features like geoprocessing tools, which allow them to make analysis of their interest, and all this absolutely for free.\nConclusion ¶ This project understood as the technological component of a Spatial Data Infrastructure, has been considered as a PostGIS case study, and I have to say that working with open source in all of our system\u0026rsquo;s cycle, has been satisfactory and trustworthy, the best choice that we have found to share our geographic information.\nAuthor ¶ Carlos Ruiz This article was contributed in July 2010 by IC Carlos Ruiz.
